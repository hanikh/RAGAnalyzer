Cautionary Statement
This presentation provides management's current operational plan for ConocoPhillips over roughly the next decade, for the assets currently in our portfolio, and is subject to multiple assumptions, including, unless otherwise specifically noted:
* anoil price of $60/BBL West Texas Intermediate in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
* anoil price of $65/BBL Brent in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
* agas price of $3.75/MMBTU Henry Hub in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
* an international gas price of $8/MMBTU Title Transfer Facility & Japan Korea Marker in 2022 dollars, escalating at 2.25% annually;
* cost and capital escalation in line with price escalation; planning case at $60/BBL WTI assumes capital de-escalation from levels observed in 2022;
* all production compound annual growth rates (CAGR) are calculated for the 10-year period 2023 — 2032;
* inclusion of carbon tax in the cash flow forecasts for assets where a tax is currently assessed. If no carbon tax exists for the asset, it is not included in the cash flow forecasts;
* Cost of Supply displayed in WTI, includes carbon tax where carbon policy exists and a proxy carbon price for assets without existing carbon policies. Please refer to the Cost of Supply definition in the Appendix for additional information on how carbon costs are included
in the Cost of Supply calculation.
As a result, this presentation contains forward-looking statements as defined under the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to future events, plans and anticipated results of operations, business strategies, and other aspects of our operations or
operating results. Graphics that project into a future date constitute forward-looking statements. Also, words and phrases such as “anticipate,” ""estimate,"" ""believe,"" ""budget,"" ""continue,"" ""could,"" ""intend,"" ""may,"" ""plan,"" “potential,” ""predict,"" ""seek,"" ""should,"" ""will,"" ""would,""
""expect,"" ""objective,"" ""projection,"" ""forecast,"" ""goal,"" ""guidance,"" ""outlook,"" ""effort,"" ""target"" and other similar words can be used to identify forward-looking statements. However, the absence of these words does not mean that the statements are not forward-looking.
Where, in any forward-looking statement, the company expresses an expectation or belief as to future results, such expectation or belief is based on management's good faith plans and objectives under the assumptions set forth above (unless noted otherwise) and
believed to be reasonable as of April 12, 2023, the date of this presentation. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties and are subject to change as management is continually assessing factors beyond our control
that may or may not be currently known. Given the foregoing and the extended time horizon of this presentation, actual outcomes and results will likely differ from what is expressed or forecast in the forward-looking statements, and such differences may be material
Factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from what is presented include changes in commodity prices, including a prolonged decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels; global and regional changes in the demand, supply,
prices, differentials or other market conditions affecting oil and gas, including changes resulting from any ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the global response to such conflict, security threats on facilities and infrastructure, or
from a public health crisis or from the imposition or lifting of crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by OPEC and other producing countries and the resulting company or third-party actions in response to such changes; insufficient liquidity or
other factors, such as those listed herein, that could impact our ability to repurchase shares and declare and pay dividends such that we suspend our share repurchase program and reduce, suspend, or totally eliminate dividend payments in the future, whether variable or
fixed; changes in expected levels of oil and gas reserves or production; potential failures or delays in achieving expected reserve or production levels from existing and future oil and gas developments, including due to operating hazards, drilling risks or unsuccessful
exploratory activities; unexpected cost increases, inflationary pressures or technical difficulties in constructing, maintaining or modifying company facilities; legislative and regulatory initiatives addressing global climate change or other environmental concerns; public health
crises, including pandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics and any impacts or related company or government policies or actions; investment in and development of competing or alternative energy sources; potential failures or delays in delivering on our current or
future low-carbon strategy, including our inability to develop new technologies; disruptions or interruptions impacting the transportation for our oil and gas production; international monetary conditions and exchange rate fluctuations; changes in international trade
relationships or governmental policies, including the imposition of price caps or the imposition of trade restrictions or tariffs on any materials or products (such as aluminum and steel) used in the operation of our business, including any sanctions imposed as a result of any
ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; our ability to collect payments when due, including our ability to collect payments from the government of Venezuela or PDVSA; our ability to complete any announced or any future dispositions or
acquisitions on time, if at all; the possibility that regulatory approvals for any announced or any future dispositions or acquisitions will not be received on a timely basis, if at all, or that such approvals may require modification to the terms of the transactions or our remaining
business; business disruptions following any announced or future dispositions or acquisitions, including the diversion of management time and attention; the ability to deploy net proceeds from our announced or any future dispositions in the manner and timeframe we
anticipate, if at all; potential liability for remedial actions under existing or future environmental regulations; potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation, including litigation related directly or indirectly to our transaction with Concho Resources Inc.; the impact
of competition and consolidation in the oil and gas industry; limited access to capital or insurance or significantly higher cost of capital or insurance related to illiquidity or uncertainty in the domestic or international financial markets or investor sentiment; general domestic
and international economic and political conditions or developments, including as a result of any ongoing military conflict, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; changes in fiscal regime or tax, environmental and other laws applicable to our business; and
disruptions resulting from accidents, extraordinary weather events, civil unrest, political events, war, terrorism, cybersecurity threats or information technology failures, constraints or disruptions; and other economic, business, competitive and/or regulatory factors affecting
our business generally as set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless legally required, ConocoPhillips expressly disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date and neither future distribution of this material nor the continued availability of this material in archive form on our website should be deemed to constitute an update or re-affirmation of these
figures as of any future date. Any future update of these figures will be provided only through a public disclosure indicating that fact.
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information — This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures, which help facilitate comparison of company operating performance across periods and with peer companies. Any historical non-GAAP measures included herein will be
accompanied by a reconciliation to the nearest corresponding GAAP measure both at the end of this presentation and on our website at www.conocophillips.com/nongaap. For forward-looking non-GAAP measures, we are unable to provide a reconciliation to the most
comparable GAAP financial measures because the information needed to reconcile these measures is dependent on future events, many of which are outside management's control as described above. Additionally, estimating such GAAP measures and providing a
meaningful reconciliation consistent with our accounting policies for future periods is extremely difficult and requires a level of precision that is unavailable for these future periods and cannot be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Forward looking non-GAAP
measures are estimated consistent with the relevant definitions and assumptions.
Cautionary Note to U.S. Investors - The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. We use terms and metrics such as ""resource"" or “Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR)"" in this presentation that
we are prohibited from using in filings with the SEC under the SEC’s guidelines. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC. Copies are available from the SEC and from the
ConocoPhillips website.

Non-GAAP Measures
Cash from operations (CFO) is calculated by removing the impact from operating working capital from cash provided by operating activities. The company believes that the non-
GAAP measure cash from operations is useful to investors to help understand changes in cash provided by operating activities excluding the impact of working capital changes
across periods on a consistent basis and with the performance of peer companies in a manner that, when viewed in combination with the Company's results prepared in accordance
with GAAP provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the Company's business and performance. Additionally, when the company estimates CFO
based on sensitivities, it assumes no operating working capital changes, and therefore CFO equals cash provided by operating activities.
Free cash flow is defined as cash from operations net of capital expenditures and investments. The company believes free cash flow is useful to investors in understanding how
existing cash from operations is utilized as a source for sustaining our current capital plan and future development growth. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for
discretionary expenditures since the company has certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure.
Net debt includes total balance sheet debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company believes this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors as it
provides a measure to compare debt less cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments across periods on a consistent basis.
Reinvestment rate defined as total capital expenditures divided by cash from operations. Cash from operations is a non-GAAP measure defined in this Appendix. The company
believes reinvestment rate is useful to investors in understanding the execution of the company’s disciplined and returns-focused capital allocation strategy.

Return on capital employed (ROCE) is a measure of the profitability of the company’s capital employed in its business operations compared with that of its peers. The company
calculates ROCE as a ratio, the numerator of which is net income, and the denominator of which is average total equity plus average total debt. The net income is adjusted for
after-tax interest expense, for the purposes of measuring efficiency of debt capital used in operations; net income is also adjusted for non-operational or special items impacts to
allow for comparability in the long-term view across periods. The company believes ROCE is a good indicator of long-term company and management performance as it relates to
capital efficiency, both absolute and relative to the company’s primary peer group.

Other Terms
Cost of Supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10% after-tax return on a point-forward and fully burdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign
exchange, price-related inflation, G&A and carbon tax (if currently assessed). If no carbon tax exists for the asset, carbon pricing aligned with internal energy scenarios are applied.
All barrels of resource in the Cost of Supply calculation are discounted at 10%.
Distributions is defined as the total of the ordinary dividend, share repurchases and variable return of cash (VROC). Also referred to as return of capital.
Free cash flow breakeven is the WTI price at which cash from operations equals capital expenditures and investments. Also referred to as capital breakeven. Cash from operations
is anon-GAAP measure defined in this Appendix.
Leverage ratio refers to net debt divided by cash from operations. Net debt and cash from operations are non-GAAP measures defined in this Appendix.
Optimized Cascade® Process is a ConocoPhillips proprietary licensed process for technology to liquefy natural gas. More information can be found at
http://Inglicensing.conocophillips.com/what-we-do/Ing-technology/optimized-cascade-process.
Reserve replacement is defined by the Company as a ratio representing the change in proved reserves, net of production, divided by current year production. The Company
believes that reserve replacement is useful to investors to help understand how changes in proved reserves, net of production, compare with the Company's current year
production, inclusive of acquisitions and dispositions.
Resources: The company estimates its total resources based on the Petroleum Resources Management System (PRMS), a system developed by industry that classifies recoverable
hydrocarbons into commercial and sub-commercial to reflect their status at the time of reporting. Proved, probable and possible reserves are classified as commercial, while
remaining resources are categorized as sub-commercial or contingent. The company’s resource estimate includes volumes associated with both commercial and contingent
categories. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable and possible reserves. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely
the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and other reports and filings with the SEC.
Resource life is calculated as total resource under $40 Cost of Supply divided by 2022 production.

Return of capital is defined as the total of the ordinary dividend, share repurchases and variable return of cash (VROC). Also referred to as distributions.
