A Message from Our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Lead Director
April 1, 2024
Dear Fellow Stockholders,
On behalf of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) and the Executive Leadership Team, weare pleased to invite you to participate in the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the“Annual Meeting”). The meeting will take place virtually on Tuesday, May 14, 2024, at 9:00a.m. Central Daylight Time. There will be no in-person meeting. The attached Notice of the2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement provides information about thebusiness we plan to conduct.
A Compelling 10-Year Plan
At our 2023 Analyst & Investor Meeting, we reaffirmed our durable returns-focused valueproposition with an updated 10-year financial plan that produces solid free cash flow,allowing us to reward stockholders now and into the future.
As we enter 2024, ConocoPhillips continues to be guided by our Triple Mandate, which setsout three objectives to align our actions with the underlying realities of our business anddemonstrates our commitment to create long-term value for our stockholders. First, we mustreliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathwaydemand. Second, we must deliver competitive returns on and of capital for our stockholders.Third, we must remain focused on achieving our net-zero operational emissions ambition. OurTriple Mandate underlies our clearly defined value proposition of delivering superior returnsthrough price cycles based on our foundational principles of balance sheet strength, peer-
leading distributions, disciplined investments, and responsible and reliable environmental,social and governance performance.
Continuing to Deliver on Each Pillar of The Triple Mandate
In 2023, we continued to deliver on each of the three mandates:
First, we achieved record full-year Lower 48 and total Company production,enhanced our diverse portfolio, and progressed our global LNG strategy.
In 2023, we delivered operationally across our diverse global portfolio with record full-
year production of 1,826 MBOED. We continued to leverage technologies and operationalexcellence to improve drilling and completion efficiencies in the Lower 48 and across ourassets. Our teams reached first production at several subsea tiebacks in Norway, SurmontPad 267 in Canada and Bohai Phase 4B in China and achieved startup at the second phase ofMontney’s central processing facility in Canada. We opportunistically acquired the remaining50% working interest in Surmont at an attractive price that fits our financial framework.Long-life, low sustaining capital assets like Surmont play an important role in our low costof supply portfolio. In addition, we reached final investment decision (FID) on Willow inAlaska, where we have over 50 years as a proven, responsible operator. Finally, we continuedto advance our global LNG strategy through expansion in Qatar, FID at Port Arthur LNG,regasification agreements in the Netherlands and offtake agreements in Mexico. We now haveequity, offtake, and regasification agreements across major global markets.
Second, we returned $11 billion to stockholders and maintained discipline on ourcost of supply framework with a continued focus on returns on and of capital.
Full year 2023 earnings were $11.0 billion, or $9.06 per share, and our net cash provided byoperating activities totaled $20.0 billion. We returned $11.0 billion to stockholders throughour three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion through our ordinary dividend and variablereturn of cash and $5.4 billion in share repurchases. This is in excess of our annual through-
the-cycle commitment to return greater than 30% of cash provided by operating activitiesto stockholders. In addition, across our portfolio we maintained discipline on our rigorouscost of supply framework to maximize our returns on capital. We are resolute in our efforts

S SAFETY
No task is so important thatwe can’t take the time to doit safely. A safe company isa successful company.
P PEOPLE
We respect one another.We recognize that oursuccess depends upon thecapabilities and inclusionof our employees. Wevalue different voicesand opinions.
I INTEGRITY
We are ethical andtrustworthy in ourrelationships with internaland external stakeholders.We keep our promises.
R RESPONSIBILITY
We are accountable for ouractions. We care about ourneighbors. Sustainability iscore to our company andcreates shared value forour stakeholders.
I INNOVATION

T TEAMWORK
We have a “can do”attitude that inspirestop performance fromeveryone. We encouragecollaboration. We celebratesuccess. We win together.

to maximize efficiencies and optimize well construction and completions designs to increase well recovery while minimizing incrementalcost of supply. As an example, we achieved improvement of completion pumping efficiencies by 10% to 15% across our Lower 48business segment.
Third, we accelerated our company’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 and wererecognized by the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 for our methane reduction efforts.
In 2023, we demonstrated meaningful progress toward our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition, including by accelerating our Scope 1and 2 GHG emissions-intensity reduction target from 40-50% to 50-60% gross operated emissions, using a 2016 baseline. We allocated aportion of our budget for projects to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and advance low carbon opportunities, including carboncapture and storage. In addition, we are in our second year of membership in the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) initiative,which seeks to improve industry transparency in methane emissions reporting and encourage progress in reducing those emissions.We were awarded the OGMP 2.0’s Gold Standard Pathway designation in recognition of our ambitious multi-year measurement-basedreporting plan which goes beyond current regulatory requirements. Additionally, 2023 marked the first year that Energy TransitionMilestones were included as a standalone metric in our Variable Cash Incentive Program, further demonstrating our commitment to ournet-zero operational emissions ambitions, by directly tying our performance on the Energy Transition Milestones to our compensation.
Looking to the Future
Now and into the future, we are focused on operational excellence with a proven track record of strong returns. Our strategy isdifferential, and we believe our portfolio is the deepest, most durable and diverse of any of our peers. In addition, we are wellpositioned for the energy transition. Safety remains a critical part of our culture, and we prioritize the safety of both our colleagues andcommunities. That means continuously looking for ways to operate more safely, efficiently, and responsibly, with a focus on reducinghuman error. We understand that this is a fundamental part of our license to operate.
Your input is valued and your vote is very important.
We strongly believe that regular engagement with all stakeholders — stockholders, employees, customers, suppliers, advocacy groups,governments, and communities — is critical to our long-term success. The Annual Meeting is an opportunity for stockholders to expresstheir views on ConocoPhillips’ business.

Executing on our Returns-Focused Value Proposition Delivers StrongFinancial and Operational Performance
Throughout 2023, ConocoPhillips demonstrated that we can deliver strong financial and operational performanceconsistent with our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles while executing againstour Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand,deliver competitive returns on and of capital to our stockholders, and focus on achieving our net-zero operationalemissions ambitions.
•  We delivered full year total and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 thousand barrels and 1,067 thousand barrels of oilequivalent per day, respectively, while we continued to enhance our portfolio diversity by opportunistically acquiring theremaining 50% working interest in Surmont, reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing ourglobal LNG strategy.
•  We achieved a 17 percent return on capital employed(1) and we delivered competitive returns of capital by distributing 
$11 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion in cash through the ordinary dividendand variable return of cash (“VROC”) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases.

We acknowledge the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that GHG emissions fromthe use of fossil fuels contribute to increases in global temperatures. We acknowledge the importance thatscience places on limiting global average temperature increases to below 2-degree Celsius compared topre-industrial times, and to achieve that, science shows that global GHG emissions need to reach net-zeroin the second half of this century. We support the Paris Agreement as a welcomed global policy response tothat challenge.
We have had a public global climate change position since 2003. The position is reviewed periodically, agreedto by the Executive Leadership Team, and then recommended to the Board.

Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies
What am I Voting On?
You are voting on a proposal to elect the 12 nominees named in this Proxy Statement to one-year terms asConocoPhillips directors.
What is the makeup of the Board of Directors and how often are themembers elected?
Our Board currently has 12 members. Directors are elected at the annual stockholder meeting each year. Any vacancyon the Board created between annual stockholder meetings (if, for example, a current director resigns or the size of theBoard is increased) may be filled by a majority vote of the remaining directors then in office. Any director appointed tofill a vacancy would hold office until the next election.
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, directors generally may not stand for reelection after they reach the ageof 72.
What if a nominee is unable or unwilling to serve?
All director nominees have consented to serve. However, should a director become unable or unwilling to serve beforethe date of the Annual Meeting and should the Board not elect to reduce the size of the Board, shares represented byproxies may be voted for a substitute nominated by the Board.
How are directors compensated?
Please see our discussion of director compensation beginning on page 53.
How are nominees selected?
The Committee on Directors’ Affairs regularly evaluates the size and composition of the Board and continually assesseswhether the composition appropriately relates to ConocoPhillips’ strategic needs, which change as the businessenvironment evolves. We seek director candidates who possess the highest personal and professional ethics, integrity,and values and who are committed to representing the long-term interest of all ConocoPhillips’ stakeholders. As somedirectors approach retirement age, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs seeks to onboard new directors to backfillthe needed skills and experience of outgoing directors with sufficient overlap in service to allow for the transfer ofinstitutional knowledge and sharing of experiences.

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines contain director independence standards consistent with the standardsprescribed in the NYSE Listed Company Manual and provide that, at all times, at least a substantial majority of theBoard must meet those standards. The Committee on Directors’ Affairs also seeks to ensure that the Board reflectsa range of talents, ages, skills, personal attributes, and expertise — particularly in the areas of leadership andmanagement, financial reporting, issues specific to oil- and gas-related industries, both domestic and internationalmarkets, public policy and government regulation, technology, public company board service, human capitalmanagement, and environmental and sustainability matters — sufficient to provide sound and prudent guidance withrespect to ConocoPhillips’ strategic needs. The Board seeks to maintain a diverse membership and also requiresthat its members be able to dedicate the time and resources necessary to ensure the diligent performance of theirduties, including attending Board and applicable committee meetings. To that end, the Committee on Directors’ Affairsconsiders the number of other boards on which each candidate already serves. Non-employee directors may notserve on more than four other boards of publicly-traded companies in addition to the Board, and ConocoPhillips' ChiefExecutive Officer may not serve on the board of more than one other publicly-traded company. Directors should seekapproval from the Chair of the Board and the Chair of the Committee on Directors’ Affairs in advance of accepting aninvitation to serve on another public company board.

Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies
The following are some of the key qualifications and skills the Committee on Directors’ Affairs considered in evaluatingthe director nominees. The chart on the next page shows how these qualifications and skills are distributed among ournominees. The individual biographies beginning on page 21 provide additional information about how each nominee’sspecific experiences, qualifications, and skills align with and further the strategic direction of ConocoPhillips.
CEO OR SENIOR OFFICER
FINANCIAL REPORTING
INDUSTRY
We believe that directors withCEO or senior officer experienceprovide valuable insights. Theseindividuals have a demonstratedrecord of leadership and a practicalunderstanding of organizations,processes, strategy, risk and riskmanagement, and the methods todrive change and growth. Throughtheir service as top leadersat other companies, they alsobring valuable perspectives oncommon issues affecting large andcomplex organizations.
We measure operating and strategicperformance by reference to financialtargets. In addition, accurate financialreporting and robust auditing arecritical to ConocoPhillips’ success.Accordingly, we seek to have a numberof directors who could qualify asaudit committee financial experts (asdefined by SEC rules), and we expectall of our directors to be financiallyknowledgeable. We also believe itis important to have knowledge andexperience in capital markets, both debtand equity, given our position as a largepublicly traded company.
We seek to have directors withsignificant experience in theenergy industry. These directorshave valuable perspective onissues specific to our business.
GLOBAL
REGULATORY/GOVERNMENT
TECHNOLOGY
As a global energy company, ourfuture success depends, in part,on how we grow our businessesoutside the United States.Directors with global businessor international experienceprovide valued perspectives onour operations.
The perspectives of directors who haveexperience within the regulatory fieldare important. The energy industry isheavily regulated and directly affectedby governmental actions and decisions,and we believe that directors withgovernment experience offer valuableinsight in this regard.
Experience or expertisein information technologyhelps us pursue and achieveour business objectives.Leadership and understandingof technology, cybersecurityrisk, cloud computing, scalabledata analytics, and big datatechnologies add exceptionalvalue to our Board as weincreasingly utilize our globaldata assets to monitor andoptimize our operations.
PUBLIC COMPANY BOARD SERVICE
ENVIRONMENTAL/SUSTAINABILITY
HUMAN CAPITALMANAGEMENT
Our sustainable development approachis integrated into ConocoPhillips’planning and decision-making. Directorswho have experience with sustainability,including through leadership roles inour industry, strengthen the Board’soversight and ensure that strategicbusiness essentials and long-termvalue creation for stockholders areachieved with a responsible, sustainablebusiness model which fosters astable and healthy environment fortomorrow and proactively addressesstakeholder interests.
We could not execute ourdifferential strategy withoutemployees, which is why wevalue directors with experiencein effectively engaging,developing, retaining, andrewarding employees and withexperience in diversity, equity,and inclusion management.
ConocoPhillips aspires to thehighest standards of corporategovernance and ethical conduct.Service on the boards and boardcommittees of other large, publiclytraded companies provides anunderstanding of corporategovernance practices and trends andinsights into: (1) board management;(2) relations between the Board, theCEO, and senior management; (3)agenda setting; and (4) successionplanning. We believe this experiencesupports our goals of strong boardand management accountability,transparency, and protection ofstockholder interests.

Item 1: Election of Directors and Director Biographies
Generally, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs identifies candidates through business and organizational contacts of thedirectors and management, though third-party search firms occasionally assist as well. Stockholders are also welcomedto recommend director candidates for consideration. If you wish to recommend a candidate for nomination to theBoard, please follow the procedures described under “Submission of Future Stockholder Proposals and Nominations” onpage 129 for nominations made directly by a stockholder. Candidates recommended by stockholders are evaluated onthe same basis as all other candidates.
What vote is required to approve this proposal?
Each nominee requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast at the Annual Meeting; the number of votescast “for” a director must exceed the number of votes cast “against” that director. In a contested election (if the numberof nominees exceeded the number of directors to be elected), directors would be elected by a plurality of the sharesrepresented at the meeting and entitled to vote on the election of directors.
What if a Director Nominee does not receive a majority of thevotes cast?
If a nominee who is serving as a director is not elected at the Annual Meeting and no one else is elected in place ofthat director, then, under Delaware law, the director continues to serve on the Board as a “holdover director.” However,under our By-Laws, a holdover director is required to tender a resignation to the Board. The Committee on Directors’Affairs then would consider the resignation and recommend to the Board whether to accept or reject it or whether someother action should be taken. The Board would then make a decision, without participation by the holdover director. TheBoard is required to disclose publicly (by a news release, filing with the SEC, or other broadly disseminated means ofcommunication) its decision regarding the tendered resignation and the rationale behind that decision within 90 daysfrom the date the election results are certified.

We are continuously evaluating the overall balance of the Board,including between longer-tenured directors with great institutionalknowledge and new directors with fresh external viewpoints. Whenconsidering candidates to fill a vacancy on the Board, the priority isfinding a candidate with the necessary skills and qualifications. Inaddition, we believe the Board benefits from diversity of race, ethnicity,gender, age, education, skills, cultural background, and professionalexperiences. While our Board consists of diverse members, one of ourlongstanding female directors recently retired and another longstandingfemale director resigned to more fully pursue other commitments. Theserecent departures have resulted in less gender diversity in the Board'scurrent composition, which it is actively seeking to improve.
In 2023, the Board undertook a search for qualified femalecandidates that could bring the right skills and experience toenhance the Board’s composition. A number of candidates havebeen reviewed and considered, and we are in the process ofselecting the right individual, including advanced discussions withone candidate. A great deal of rigor and care is put into the Boardrefreshment process, which requires time for director selection andonboarding. Nonetheless, we are committed to onboarding at leastone new female director by the end of 2024.
As part of our Board’s commitment to regular renewal and refreshment:
•  The Committee on Directors’ Affairs routinely and on an ongoing
basis assesses the Board’s composition, taking into consideration anyplanned retirements for the Board, as well as background and diversity(including gender, ethnicity, race, national origin, and geographicbackground);
•  We have implemented an annual Board and Committee assessment
process; and
•  We have adopted Corporate Governance Guidelines that state that
directors generally may not stand for re-election after they reach theage of 72.
Five of the 12 director nominees have joined the Board in the past 5 years.Almost 42 percent of our director nominees are women or racially/
ethnically diverse individuals. The average age of our director nominees is63 and the average tenure of our director nominees is 6 years.

Board and Committee Evaluations
Each year, the Board performs a rigorous full Board evaluation, and each director performs a self-evaluation and anevaluation of each of his or her peers. Generally, the evaluation process described below is managed by the CorporateSecretary’s office with oversight by the Committee on Directors’ Affairs. However, the Committee on Directors’ Affairsperiodically retains an independent third party to manage the evaluation process to ensure it remains as thorough andtransparent as possible.

EVALUATIONQUESTIONNAIRES
•  Formal opportunity for directors to identify potential improvements
•  Solicit candid feedback from each director regarding the performanceand effectiveness of the Board, its committees, and individual directors
2 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS
3 REVIEW OF FEEDBACK
•  Lead Director has an in-depth conversation with each member of the Board
•  Lead Director reviews questionnaire and interview responses with
Committee on Directors’ Affairs
•  Lead Director reviews questionnaire and interview responses with full
Board in executive session
4 USE OF 
FEEDBACK
•  The Committee on Directors’ Affairs develops recommendations
•  The Committee on Directors’ Affairs and the Lead Director identify areas
for improvement of individual directors and of the Board as a whole
•  The Committee on Directors’ Affairs uses the results of individual
director evaluations as a part of the nomination process for the nextannual meeting
5  CHANGES 
IMPLEMENTED
•  As a result of this evaluation process, the Board has strengthened its
structure and procedures in the following ways over the past few years:
 – achieved successful transitions of committee leadership roles;
 – provided more materials as pre-read to improve efficiencies at meetings and allow
more time for discussion and deliberation;
 – more robust committee reports to the full Board;
 – individual director coaching; and
 – added new highly skilled directors to enhance the Board’s composition.
In addition to participating in the full Board evaluation, members of each committee also complete a detailedquestionnaire annually to evaluate how well the committee is operating and to suggest improvements. Each committee’sChair summarizes the responses and reviews them with the members of his or her respective committee.
The Committee on Directors’ Affairs reviews these evaluation processes annually and develops any changes it deemsnecessary to maintain best practices.

Board Leadership Structure
BOARD OVERVIEW
•  Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer: Ryan M. Lance
•  Lead Director: 
Robert A. Niblock
•  Active engagement by all directors
•  Ten of our 12 director nominees
are independent
•  All members of the Audit and Finance Committee,Human Resources and Compensation Committee,Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, andCommittee on Directors’ Affairs are independent
Annual Evaluation of Leadership Structure and Annual Election ofIndependent Lead Director
ConocoPhillips believes that independent board oversight is an essential component of strong corporate performanceand enhances stockholder value. The Board believes there is no single organizational model that is the best and mosteffective in all circumstances. As a result, the Board periodically considers whether the offices of Chairman and CEOshould be combined or separated and who should serve in such capacities.
Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, our Board chooses its Chairman based on what is in the best interestof ConocoPhillips and our stockholders. The Chairman and CEO may, but need not, be the same person. As part of itsannual review and evaluation process, the Board reviews its leadership structure and whether combining or separatingthe roles of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips and our stockholders.
Our Corporate Governance Guidelines require that, in the event the Board determines that it is in the best interest ofConocoPhillips and its stockholders for the offices of Chairman and CEO to be held by the same person (or in the eventthe office of Chairman is not held by the CEO, but is nonetheless not independent), an independent lead director mustbe selected from among the non-employee directors. The Board will continue to reexamine its corporate governancepolicies and leadership structures on an ongoing basis to ensure that they continue to meet our needs.
For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring theBoard of Directors to amend the governing documents, as necessary, to separate the role of CEO and Chairman. Afterevaluating the proposal, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs determined that it is in the best interest of ConocoPhillipsand its stockholders to maintain flexibility in our governing documents to allow the Board of Directors to determinewhat organizational model best serves the interest of our company and its stockholders. The proposal failed to receivesignificant support in 2023, with only approximately 25% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal assubmitted. During engagements in 2023, stockholders were interested in learning about our leadership structure, andappreciated hearing about how our board has the responsibility to review the governance structure on a regular andongoing basis, allowing for adaptability. Stockholders expressed support for the Board of Directors continuing to evaluatewhether the combined role of Chairman and CEO is in the best interest of the Company.

Board Independence
The Corporate Governance Guidelines contain director independence standards that are consistent with the standardsset forth in the NYSE Listed Company Manual to assist the Board in determining the independence of ConocoPhillips’non-employee directors. Under such standards, the Board has determined that all non-employee directors meet thestandards regarding independence set forth in the Corporate Governance Guidelines and are free of any materialrelationship with ConocoPhillips (either directly or indirectly as a partner, stockholder, or officer of an organization thathas a relationship with ConocoPhillips). In making such determination, the Board specifically considered the fact thatmany of our directors may be directors, retired officers, and stockholders of companies with which we conduct business.In addition, some of our directors may serve as employees of, or consultants or advisors to, companies that do businesswith ConocoPhillips and its affiliates. In all cases, the Board determined that the nature of the business conducted andthe interest of the director by virtue of such position were immaterial both to ConocoPhillips and to the director.
In recommending that each non-employee director is independent, our Board, with input from the Committee onDirectors’ Affairs, considered relationships that, while not constituting related-party transactions in which a director hada direct or indirect material interest, nonetheless involved transactions between ConocoPhillips and a company withwhich a director is affiliated, whether through employment status or by virtue of serving as a director. Included in theCommittee’s review were the following transactions, which occurred in the ordinary course of business. In all instances,it was determined that the nature of the business conducted and the dollar amounts involved were immaterial, both toConocoPhillips and the relevant counterparty, and fell within independence standards set forth in the ConocoPhillipsCorporate Governance Guidelines and the NYSE Listed Company Manual.

Related Party Transactions
In accordance with SEC and NYSE rules, we maintain a policy on related party transactions (“Related Party TransactionPolicy”), which requires the Audit and Finance Committee to review all Reportable Related Party Transactions inadvance. A Reportable Related Party Transaction is a transaction, arrangement, or relationship (or series of similartransactions, arrangements, or relationships) in which:
•  We (or one of our subsidiaries) was, is or will be a participant;
•  The aggregate amount involved exceeds $120,000 in any fiscal year; and
•  Any person who is, or at any time since the beginning of ConocoPhillips’ last fiscal year was, an executive officer,
director, director nominee, or holder of at least 5 percent of our equity securities (each a “Covered Person”), or any ofsuch Covered Person’s immediate family members, had, has, or will have a direct or indirect material interest.
In accordance with the Related Party Transaction Policy, Covered Persons are required to identify business andfinancial affiliations involving themselves or their immediate family members that could reasonably be expected to giverise to a Reportable Related Party Transaction. Based on this information, our legal staff, in consultation with the financeteam, performs the necessary diligence to determine whether any such Reportable Related Party Transaction existsor will exist, once completed. Upon determining that a transaction is or will be a Reportable Related Party Transaction,the General Counsel presents all relevant facts and circumstances to the Audit and Finance Committee, which reviewstransactions for materiality and determines whether the transaction is in the best interest of ConocoPhillips, beforeeither approving or disapproving it. In making its decision, the Audit and Finance Committee considers whether thetransaction is on terms comparable to those that could be obtained in arm’s-length dealings with an unrelated thirdparty and the extent of the Covered Person’s interest in the transaction, taking into account the conflicts of interestprovisions of ConocoPhillips’ Code of Business Ethics and Conduct and such other factors as it believes are relevant.The Audit and Finance Committee shall prohibit any transactions that it determines are inconsistent with the interestsof ConocoPhillips and its stockholders.
The Audit and Finance Committee approved the following Reportable Related Party Transactions:
Cameron J. Smith, son-in-law of William L. Bullock, Jr., our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, wasemployed in a non-executive position. The aggregate value of the compensation paid to Mr. Smith during fiscal year2023 was approximately $346,312, consisting of salary, annual incentive (earned in fiscal 2023 and paid in fiscal2024), and restricted stock unit awards. In addition, Mr. Smith received the standard benefits provided to other non-
executive ConocoPhillips employees for his services during fiscal year 2023.
Timothy A. Leach serves as a director and also an employee of the company, but not as an executive officer.Mr. Leach receives compensation from the company for the services he provides as an employee.

Managing Cybersecurity Risks
Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our infrastructure, resources, and information is a criticalpart of risk management at ConocoPhillips, which is why we take a multilayered approach.
•  The full Board receives a report on cybersecurity risks annually and the Audit and Finance Committee receives
reports on cybersecurity risks multiple times per year.
•  ConocoPhillips has a dedicated Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) who is responsible for overseeingthe cybersecurity program and works with a cybersecurity team, including Directors of IT and OT SecurityArchitecture and a Manager of Cyber Security Operations Center (CSOC), who is responsible for detection,investigation, and response to cybersecurity incidents (collectively, the “IT/OT Security Team”).
•  The IT/OT Security Team has a CSOC Incident Handling Process and a Computer Security Incident ResponsePlan (CSIRP), which govern the Company’s response to cybersecurity incidents. These processes and plansinclude escalation based on a defined incident categorization to the CISO, senior managers and othercybersecurity program stakeholders, including senior leadership, the Audit and Finance Committee, and internaland external legal advisors.
•  In addition to a CSIRP, ConocoPhillips maintains a robust set of IT/OT Security policies, standards, and
procedures to govern our program and to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks and effects of, and recoverfrom, cyber-related threats. These policies and procedures are reviewed and updated regularly to help protectand enhance our security posture.
•  ConocoPhillips has a third-party risk management program designed to identify, assess, and mitigate risks
associated with third-party service providers, including cybersecurity risks.
Managing Sustainability-Related Risks
Our governance structure is designed to ensure that management of sustainability-related risks and opportunitiesthroughout the organization is incorporated into our business strategy and key decision-making. Our governancemodel extends from the Board’s Public Policy and Sustainability Committee, through the Executive LeadershipTeam (“ELT”), to leaders and internal subject matter experts.

This framework provides oversight of oursustainable development positions and related strategic planning and risk management policies and procedures.
We use a management system approach to assess, and manage sustainability risks, including climate, nature andsocial-related risks. This system links directly to the enterprise risk management process, which includes an annual riskreview by executive leadership and the Board.

Managing Climate-Related Risks
As we manage through the energy transition, oil and natural gas will remain an essential part of the energy supplymix in a low-carbon world, and flexibility and resilience will be required to ensure that supply. In 2020, we adopteda climate-related risk framework with an ambition to reduce our operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions to net-zeroby 2050. The objective of our Climate Risk Strategy is to manage climate-related risk, optimize opportunities andequip the company to respond to changes in key uncertainties, including government policies around the world,emissions reduction technologies, alternative energy technologies and changes in consumer trends.
Scenario analysis is an important aspect of our strategic planning process that enables us to:
•  Gain a better understanding of external factors that impact our business;
•  Identify leading indicators and trends;
•  Test the robustness of our strategy across different business environments;
•  Communicate risks appropriately; and
•  Inform how we position our business as technologies and markets evolve.
Combined with our focus on developing the lowest cost of supply resources and low GHG intensity assets, webelieve our climate risk framework is the most effective way for our company to sustainably compete in the energy transition.
Managing Nature-Related Risks
Our activities and operations can contribute to nature-related risks including resource use through freshwaterwithdrawal or consumption and land-use change through infrastructure footprint resulting in habitat disturbance,reduced habitat intactness and impacts on species distribution.
Fresh water is a limited resource in regions experiencing water scarcity, and local availability may be affected inthe future by physical effects of climate change, such as droughts. We manage water risks and mitigate potentialimpacts to water resources locally, taking into account the unique social, economic, and environmental conditionsof each basin or offshore marine area.
Biodiversity loss is a global challenge that requires local mitigation solutions. We manage risks and mitigateimpacts to areas with biological or cultural significance using the Mitigation Hierarchy. We support habitat andspecies conservation through strategic and proactive conservation initiatives in collaboration with conservation partners.
Managing Social-Related Risks
We engage with local stakeholders — those who may impact or be impacted by our business — to understandtheir values and interests, reduce the impact of operations and proposed projects, and support economic andcommunity development opportunities. We seek solutions that create mutually beneficial relationships and buildlong-term value for both the company and our stakeholders.
Managing Succession Planning Risks
Management succession planning is a fundamental and ongoing part of the Board's responsibilities and is reviewedby the full Board annually. In addition, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee reviews and reportsto the Board annually on the succession-planning process for the CEO and senior management for normal courseof business, both short- and long-term, and in situations for which the CEO or senior management unexpectedlybecomes unable to perform the responsibilities of their positions. Our robust, evergreen process ensures we havethe right talent in place to deliver on our strategy.

What We Learned
Strategy
•  Stockholders appreciated the opportunity to be updated on our strategy.
•  Several stockholders asked questions on recent acquisition and divestiture activity, including potential impacts to
ESG-related targets.
Sustainability
•  Stockholders supported our climate strategy and appreciated hearing how we were progressing against our Plan for the Net-
Zero Energy Transition. See “Progress Report on Our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition” beginning on page 14.
•  Stockholders consistently commented on the quality of our disclosures, including around Scope 3 emissions.
•  Several stockholders commended us on our water disclosures and metrics, and our forward-looking approach to
nature-related disclosures.
Executive Compensation
•  The majority of stockholders either had no questions or concerns about our compensation or indicated support of programs
and recent changes.
•  The overwhelming majority of stockholders expressed support for how we have tied ESG goals into our short-term
incentive program.
•  Stockholders supported the increase in our CEO’s stock ownership guidelines from six to eight times salary and did not
request additional changes.
For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiringNEOs to retain a significant percentage of shares acquired from equity compensation plans until reaching normalretirement age. After evaluating the proposal, the HRCC determined that increasing the CEO’s stock ownershipguidelines from six to eight times salary achieved the appropriate balance of being consistent with market practices,enabling us to attract and retain executive talent, and having robust ownership guidelines that align executivecompensation with stockholder interests. The proposal failed to receive significant support in 2023 with less than 23%of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted. During engagements in 2023, stockholders weresupportive of the change made by the HRCC and did not request any additional changes.
Human Capital Management
•  Stockholders were interested in hearing more detail related to CEO succession planning. See “Managing Succession Planning

•  Stockholders remain interested in hearing about the results of our Perspectives survey and our approach to DEI. See “A

•  Stockholders wanted to learn more about our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce, including how we measure
and analyze employee engagement. See “Valuing our People” on page 52.
Governance
•  Stockholders had questions about our board refreshment and gender diversity, but expressed appreciation for our
disclosures and our focus on finding the right candidates for our board. See “Board Composition and Refreshment” on page 33.
•  Stockholders were interested in learning about our leadership structure, and appreciated hearing about how our board has the
flexibility and responsibility to review the governance structure on a regular and ongoing basis. See “Board Leadership Structure”beginning on page 36.
For the 2023 Proxy Statement, we received a stockholder proposal asking stockholders to vote in favor of requiring theBoard of Directors to amend the governing documents, as necessary, to separate the role of CEO and Chairman. Afterevaluating the proposal, the Committee on Directors’ Affairs determined that it is in the best interest of ConocoPhillipsand its stockholders to maintain flexibility in our governing documents to allow the Board of Directors to determinewhat organizational model best serves the interest of our company and its stockholders. The proposal failed toreceive significant support in 2023, with only approximately 25% of stockholders indicating support for the proposalas submitted.

Our ELT and our Board play key roles in setting our HCM strategy and drivingaccountability for meaningful progress. The ELT and Board engage often onworkforce-related topics, including DEI, succession planning, and employeefeedback. Our HCM programs are supported by business leaders acrossConocoPhillips and overseen and administered by our human resources function.
Key Elements of our HCM Strategy
We depend on our workforce to successfully execute our company’s strategy,and we recognize the importance of creating a workplace where our people feelvalued. Our HCM programs are built around three pillars that we believe arenecessary for success: a compelling culture, attracting a world-class workforce,and valuing our people. Each of these pillars is described in more detail belowand is subject to oversight by our HRCC of the Board of Directors.
VALUES AND PRINCIPLES
Our human capital management(“HCM”) strategy is built upon thestrong foundation of our SPIRIT Valuesand is responsive to feedback fromkey stakeholders. Our SPIRIT Values —Safety, People, Integrity, Responsibility,Innovation, and Teamwork — set usapart, align our workforce and provide afoundation for our culture. These valuesset the tone for how we interact with allour stakeholders, internally and externally,and are a source of pride. Our day-to-daywork is also guided by the principles ofaccountability and performance, whichmeans the way we do our work is asimportant as the results we deliver.

A Compelling Culture
How we do our work is what sets us apart and drives our performance. We are experts in what we do and continuouslyfind ways to do our jobs better.

Spotlight Story:
Lower 48 Program Ensures Mental Wellness Support Is Justa Colleague Away
Mental health matters. To ensure employees have access to resources designed to support their mental healthneeds, the Lower 48 business unit launched the Mental Health Allyship Program in 2023. As part of this program,22 employee volunteers serve as Mental Health Allies (“Allies”) to serve as a first point of contact, directingcolleagues to internal resources, like the company’s Employee Assistance Program or outside resources in theirarea. Supported by the company’s mental health experts, Allies have received training to recognize when someonemay be struggling or experiencing a decline in their mental well-being. While not professional counselors, Allieshelp “get the conversation started.” Programs like this help us continue to build an inclusive and diverse workenvironment that embraces our SPIRIT Values.
ADVANCING OUR DEI JOURNEY
As our industry evolves, we’ll continue to face both new opportunities and challenges. So, we’ll need the best andbrightest people who bring passion and excitement for solving important problems. We also need to cultivate anenvironment where everyone is encouraged and able to contribute — no matter their role, level or location. This is howinnovation thrives, leading to better business outcomes. That is why we’ve put an emphasis on — and are committed to —elevating DEI and creating a great place to work.
At ConocoPhillips, we believe our unique differences power the future of energy. Our DEI vision is to foster an inclusiveculture that values the rich mixture of backgrounds, identities, and workstyles of our people, built on equitable practicesthat support all employees in unlocking their full potential. Our commitment to DEI is foundational to our SPIRITValues and to achieving our business objectives. All employees play a part in creating and sustaining an inclusive workenvironment because everyone benefits from DEI.
The ELT has ultimate accountability for advancing our DEI commitments through a governance structure that includesa Chief Diversity Officer (CDO), a dedicated DEI organization, and a global DEI Council consisting of senior leadersfrom across the company. The company sets goals and measures progress based on a transparent DEI strategy withfour pillars that guide our focus and approach: people, programs and processes, culture, and our external brand andreputation. All company leaders are accountable for advancing DEI through local efforts. Our DEI efforts and progressare regularly reviewed with the Board.
Our 2023 focus was on building clarity and connection. Over the course of the year, the CDO and DEI organizationsought to align leaders and employees across the company to the refreshed DEI strategy. Highlights from our 2023 DEIaccomplishments include:
•  Launching our refreshed DEI strategy;
•  Reviewing the results of the 2023 Perspectives survey and continuing to integrate the insights into our DEI efforts;
•  Updating governance and membership for both global and business unit and functional DEI Councils;
•  Enhancing our Employee Networks by clarifying their strategic intent and creating a consistent sponsorship structure;
•  Hosting workshops tailored to business units to further educate on the definitions of DEI; and
•  Developing a training called DEI Foundations and launching it to senior leadership.

MEASURING OUR PROGRESS
We actively monitor diversity metrics on a global basis. We are committed to being transparent as we build amore diverse and inclusive workplace. Starting in 2019, we published our first DEI Dashboards internally, whichcontained key DEI statistics for our global and U.S. employees. In keeping with our annual process, we continue toupdate the dashboards with global and U.S. workforce metrics and industry benchmark data to help compare ourinternal metrics against the external market and our peers.
Making the data visible is an important step in our DEI journey, but what we do with this information is whatmatters. Our CDO and DEI Council, in conjunction with the ELT, review these metrics and identify appropriate plansand priorities to address trends. We also continue to educate and inform our workforce on underlying trends toraise awareness.
Externally, we publish our workforce metrics and HCM disclosures in our Consolidated EEO-1 Reports,Sustainability Report and Human Capital Management Report.
We know that for DEI to be sustainable, we need programs and processes that are disciplined, and promote fair,consistent, and equitable treatment of all employees. By ensuring equity in our people-related programs and processes,we can help advance DEI within the company. Some of our focus areas include:
•  Performance management: Assigning all employees a “how” rating as part of our performance management process
to hold our workforce and our leaders accountable for behaviors, including those that advance DEI.
•  Recognition: Awarding a prestigious SPIRIT of Performance Award for DEI advocates.
•  Employee Networks: Sponsoring broad participation in our extensive Employee Networks and aligning their work to
our DEI pillars.
Spotlight Story:
LIFT off!
In March 2023, more than 130 petrotechnical employees from around the world gathered in Houston for aspecial learning event, Learning and Innovation for Today and Tomorrow or “LIFT.” LIFT originated in 2019 and isa technical training event for global petrotechnical professionals designed to promote employee engagement,foster innovation, reinforce leadership skills, and drive cross-discipline collaboration and networking.
LIFT participants came from a variety of backgrounds and business units, ranging from Geoscience to HSE,and Lower 48 to Qatar. Early and mid-career employees were nominated to participate in the program to buildknowledge and expand their networks.
Participants left with new problem-solving techniques and enhanced communications skills to help conveycomplex, technical ideas. Importantly, participants formed connections with peers across the globe.
Attracting a World-Class Workforce
Our success depends on having the right workforce to meet our business needs. Attracting a skilled, engaged, anddiverse workforce is a top priority. We have taken significant actions to embed equity and inclusion into our recruitingpractices, from adapting the way we construct job descriptions to striving for our recruiting pipelines to reflect thediversity of the communities in which we operate. To attract top talent for full-time positions and internships, we recruitfrom a number of universities in the U.S. By attending conferences and recruiting at Hispanic-serving institutions andHBCUs, we continue broadening our pipeline of talent. We closely monitor recruitment metrics through our universityand experienced hire dashboards in areas such as gender, ethnicity, and acceptance rates to observe the diversitycomposition of the candidate pool from application to offer. In addition, voluntary attrition metrics are routinely trackedand disclosed to guide our retention activities, as necessary. We believe our Employee Networks, our emphasis on talentdevelopment, and our commitment to DEI, create an environment that promotes retention of our workforce.

Valuing our People
EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
Developing our world-class workforce is a critical focus for ConocoPhillips. We want employees to feel valued andto add value. Our workforce is developed through a combination of on-the-job learning, formal training, and regularfeedback and mentoring. Skill-based TMTs guide employee development and career progression by skills andlocation. The TMTs help identify our future business needs and assess the availability of critical skill sets withinConocoPhillips. Annually, business leadership and TMTs meet to review succession benches, calibrate talent, andprovide recommendations to executive leadership and the Board on future leadership roles that will promote businesscontinuity. We use a performance management program focused on objectivity, credibility, and transparency. Theprogram includes broad stakeholder feedback, real-time recognition, and a formal rating to assess behaviors to ensurethey are in line with our SPIRIT Values. Supervisors have access to a voluntary 360-feedback tool to receive feedbackon their strengths and opportunities relative to these competencies. We also offer training on a broad range of technicaland professional skills, from data analytics to communication skills.
Taking steps to measure and assess employee satisfaction and engagement is at the heart of long-term businesssuccess and creating a great place to work for our global workforce. Since 2019, the ConocoPhillips PerspectivesSurvey has been our primary listening platform for gathering feedback on employee sentiment and strengtheningour “Who We Are” culture. Leaders analyze the survey data and comments and then identify focus areas for actionat both the enterprise and local level. In 2023, our Perspectives survey touched on key themes related to employeesatisfaction, company strategy, leadership, career development, DEI, and well-being. We transparently share our surveyresults internally with global employees, and we also disclose key metrics externally in our HCM report. We look forincremental progress on key drivers of employee satisfaction over time and leverage global and industry benchmarkdata to help provide transparency on our internal metrics against our peers.
COMPENSATION, BENEFITS, AND HEALTH AND WELL-BEING
The HRCC oversees many of our employee compensation programs. Our compensation programs are competitivewith local markets and are comprised of a base pay rate, the annual Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”) and, foreligible employees, the Restricted Stock Unit (“RSU”) program. From the CEO to the frontline worker, every employeeparticipates in VCIP, which aligns employee compensation with ConocoPhillips’ success on critical performancemetrics and also recognizes individual performance. Our RSU program is designed to attract and retain employees,reward performance, and align employee interest with stockholders by encouraging stock ownership. Our retirementand savings plans are intended to support employees’ financial futures and are competitive within local markets. Ourbenefits program provides coverage for families requiring disability support, elder care, and child care, including onsitechild care, where access locally is a challenge.

Director Compensation
Our non-employee director compensation program consists primarily of an equity component and a cash component,which is detailed below.
Objectives and Principles
The Board’s goal in designing non-employee director compensation is to provide a competitive program that will enableus to attract and retain highly skilled individuals with relevant experience to oversee ConocoPhillips’ strategic direction.Our compensation program also reflects the time and talent required to serve on the board of a complex, multinationalcorporation. The Board seeks to provide sufficient flexibility in the form of compensation to meet directors’ varyingneeds while ensuring that a substantial portion of compensation is linked to the long-term success of ConocoPhillips.
The Board approves levels of compensation after a recommendation from the Committee on Directors’ Affairs, whichconducts an annual review with an independent compensation consultant. In 2023, the Committee on Directors’ Affairsmet with an independent compensation consultant to review the non-employee director compensation program andto determine whether to recommend any changes to that program. The review included comparisons of directorcompensation levels with the compensation reference group. See “Process for Determining Executive Compensation —Setting Target Compensation — Compensation Reference Group” beginning on page 79. The consultant noted that ourdirector compensation program was within the limits set out in the stockholder-approved 2023 Omnibus Stock andPerformance Incentive Plan under which director awards are made. Effective July 1, 2023, the Board approved, on thebasis of benchmarking data, the following compensation changes:
•  Increase the cash compensation for the Lead Director from $45,000 to $50,000
•  Increase the cash compensation for the Chair of the Committee on Directors’ Affairs from $15,000 to $20,000

Equity Compensation
Non-employee directors receive an annual grant of restricted stock units with an aggregate value of $220,000 on thedate of grant. The restricted stock units are fully vested at grant and are credited with dividend equivalents in the formof additional restricted stock units, but they cannot be sold or otherwise transferred. In the case of any newly electeddirectors, the initial annual equity grant is prorated for the year of election from and including the month of election.
Prior to each annual grant, a director may elect the schedule on which the transfer restrictions will lapse. Whenrestrictions lapse, a director will receive unrestricted shares of ConocoPhillips stock in exchange for his or her restrictedstock units. Regardless of the schedule a director elects, all restrictions on a director’s restricted stock units will lapsein the event of the director’s retirement, disability, or death, or upon a change in control of ConocoPhillips, unless thedirector has elected to defer receipt of the shares until a later date. Directors forfeit restricted stock units if, beforerestrictions lapse (and prior to any change in control), the Board finds sufficient cause for forfeiture.
Cash Compensation
The non-employee director compensation program, as approved by the Board, consists of the following cash compensation:
•  Non-employee director annual cash compensation — $115,000
•  Lead Director — $50,000(1)
•  Chair of the Audit and Finance Committee — $35,000
•  Chair of the Human Resources and Compensation Committee — $27,500
•  Chair of the Public Policy and Sustainability Committee — $27,500
•  Chair of the Committee on Directors’ Affairs — $20,000(1)
•  All other Audit and Finance Committee members — $10,000
•  All other Human Resources and Compensation Committee members — $7,500
•  All other Public Policy and Sustainability Committee members — $7,500
•  All other Committee on Directors’ Affairs members — $5,000
This cash compensation is payable in monthly installments. Each director may elect, on an annual basis, to receive allor part of the cash compensation in unrestricted stock or restricted stock units or to have the amount credited to adeferred compensation account. Any such unrestricted stock or restricted stock units will be issued on the last businessday of each month and valued using the average of the high and the low market prices of ConocoPhillips common stockon such date. The restricted stock units issued in lieu of cash compensation are subject to the same restrictions as theannual restricted stock units described under “Equity Compensation” above.
(1)  For the period January 2023 to June 2023, the additional cash compensation for the Lead Director and Chair of Committee on Directors’ Affairs was
$45,000 and $15,000, respectively.
Deferral of Compensation
Non-employee directors can elect to defer their cash compensation into the Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-
Employee Directors of ConocoPhillips (“Director Deferral Plan”). Deferred amounts are deemed to be invested in variousmutual funds and similar investment choices, including ConocoPhillips common stock, as selected by the director froma prescribed list.
Matching Gift Program
Active non-employee directors are eligible to participate in the ConocoPhillips Matching Gift Program. This programprovides a dollar-for-dollar match of a donation of cash or securities (up to a maximum of $10,000 annually per donor) totax-exempt charities and educational institutions, excluding religious, political, fraternal, or athletic organizations. TheBoard believes the Matching Gift Program is consistent with ConocoPhillips’ commitment to social responsibility.

Other Compensation
We provide transportation or reimburse the cost of transportation when a non-employee director travels onConocoPhillips business, including to attend meetings of the Board or a committee. From time to time, spouses andother guests of directors may be invited to attend certain meetings at the request of the Board. The Board believes thiscreates a collegial environment that enhances the effectiveness of the Board. If spouses or other guests are invited toattend meetings, ConocoPhillips reimburses directors for the out-of-pocket cost of the additional travel and relatedincidental expenses. Any such reimbursement is treated by the Internal Revenue Service as taxable income to theapplicable director. Non-employee directors do not receive gross-ups to compensate for the resulting income taxesexcept in connection with the presentation of a retirement gift.
Stock Ownership
Each non-employee director is expected to own ConocoPhillips stock in the amount of the aggregate annual equitygrants received during his or her first five years on the Board. Directors are expected to reach this level of targetownership within five years after joining the Board. Actual shares of stock, restricted stock, or restricted stock units,including deferred stock units, may be counted in satisfying the stock ownership guidelines. The holdings of each of ourdirectors currently meet or exceed these guidelines.

(a)  Includes any amounts that were voluntarily deferred under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan.
(b)  Includes the first installment of the payment due under the non-compete, non-solicitation, and confidentiality agreement as outlined in Exhibit10.1 to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ending June 30, 2022. If Mr. Leach breaches this agreement, he is required to repayany amounts previously paid to him under the agreement.
(c)  Amount represents the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made under the Performance Share Program (“PSP”) and the Executive
Restricted Stock Unit Program (“ERSUP”), as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See the “Employee Benefit Plans” sectionof Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of therelevant assumptions used in this determination.  For the awards granted for PSP 23 and for 2023 restricted stock units (“RSUs”) under theERSUP, the grant date fair value was $112.50, but as noted in the Equity Grant Practices outlined on page 95 awards are granted using theaverage of the closing prices on the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant ($112.658). The difference between these values can increaseor decrease the reported amounts from year to year even if target compensation does not change.  For 2023, Mr. Leach received a grantof 6,835 RSUs under the ERSUP with a value of $768,938. Mr. Leach received a target grant of 12,737 performance stock units for PSP 23for the January 2023 – December 2025 performance period with a value of $1,432,913. The PSP grant is valued at target because it is mostprobable at the setting of the target for the applicable performance periods that targets will be achieved. If payout was made at maximumlevels for company performance the number of performance stock units and value would double from the target, although the value of theactual payout would be dependent upon the stock price and accrued dividend equivalent units at the time of the payout. If payout was made atminimum levels, the number of performance stock units and value would be reduced to zero.
(d)  The amount shown includes amounts paid under the Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”).
(e)  Includes $107,926 related to pre-approved personal travel on company aircraft, based on the approximate aggregate incremental cost to
ConocoPhillips for such personal use, including travel for any family member or personal guest. Approximate aggregate incremental cost hasbeen determined by calculating the variable costs for each aircraft during the year, dividing that amount by the total number of miles flownby that aircraft, and multiplying the result by the miles flown for personal use during the year. However, where there were identifiable costsrelated to a particular trip — such as fuel, airport landing fees or food and lodging for aircraft personnel who remained at the location of thepersonal trip — those amounts are separately determined and included. The amounts shown include incremental costs associated with flightsto the hangar or other locations without passengers (commonly referred to as “deadhead” flights) arising from the non-business use of theaircraft.  Mr. Leach has entered into an aviation lease agreement with the company under which reimbursement, subject to FAA limitations,is provided for certain flights which are personal in nature. Amounts included reflect aggregate incremental cost net of reimbursements. Lease reimbursements are allocated to the flight to which they relate but may be paid in a different year due to lease administration.

Amounts also include$13,834 for tax gross up payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the employee. These taxes arise primarily whenConocoPhillips requests family members or other guests to accompany the employee to a function, and, as a result, the employee is deemedto make a personal use of company assets (for example, when a spouse accompanies an employee on a company aircraft). ConocoPhillipsbelieves such expenses are appropriately characterized as a business expense, and, if the employee has imputed income in accordance withthe applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips will generally reimburse any increased tax costs.

Corporate Governance at ConocoPhillips
(a)  The amounts shown are for payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the director for imputed income. These occurred whena retirement presentation was made to Ms. Devine upon her retirement from the Board. ConocoPhillips has a practice of making gift presentationsto its retiring directors, especially those of long service. The fair value of the retirement presentation was imputed to Ms. Devine’s income. In suchcircumstances, if a director is imputed income in accordance with applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips generally will reimburse the director forthe resulting increased tax costs. All such tax reimbursements have been included above, regardless of whether the corresponding perquisite orpersonal benefit is required to be reported pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. 
(b)  The amount shown is the fair value of the retirement presentation and cost for Ms. Devine. ConocoPhillips has a practice of making gift
presentations to its retiring directors, especially those of long service. 
(c)  The amounts shown are imputed amounts when, following a board meeting, the director was returned to a location other than their point of origin ortheir tax home and therefore considered to be a personal accommodation or when, in route to or from a board meeting, a personal accommodationwas made to make more efficient use of a director’s time and travel requirements.
(d)  ConocoPhillips maintains a Matching Gift Program under which we match certain gifts by directors to charities and educational institutions,
excluding religious, political, fraternal, or athletic organizations, that are tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of theUnited States or meet similar requirements under the applicable law of other countries. For active directors, the program matches up to $10,000in each program year. Administration of the program can cause us to pay more than $10,000 in a single fiscal year due to a lag in processingclaims. The amounts shown are for the actual payments by ConocoPhillips in 2023. As indicated above, Mr. Lance and Mr. Leach are eligible for theMatching Gift Program as employees rather than as directors.
(6)  Ms. Devine retired from the Board effective May 16, 2023. The amounts in the table above include her prorated compensation reflecting the portion of
2023 that she served as a director.

Executive Overview
2023 Compensation Program Structure
Each year the HRCC, advised by its independent compensation consultant and informed by feedback from stockholders,undertakes a rigorous process to establish and review executive compensation. The HRCC believes a substantialportion of our executive compensation should be equity-based and focused on rewarding long-term performance andfurthermore, that this approach most closely aligns the interests of our top executives with those of our stockholders.
The four primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to provide a target total value forcompensation that is competitive with our peers and attracts and retains the talented executives necessary to managea large and complex company like ConocoPhillips. The following chart summarizes the principal components of ourexecutive compensation program and the performance drivers of each element.

2023 Say on Pay Vote Result, Stockholder Engagement, andBoard Responsiveness
ConocoPhillips regularly engages in dialogue with stockholders to continue to reinforce our understanding ofstockholder views regarding our compensation programs, and stockholder feedback is considered a fundamental partof our success. The Board and the HRCC appreciate these valuable discussions and continue to encourage stockholdersto provide feedback about our executive compensation programs as described on page 53 under “Communications withthe Board of Directors.”
STRONG SAY ON PAY SUPPORT IN 2023
We continue to remain committed to our stockholder engagement as we value our stockholders’ input on our executivecompensation programs. We are pleased with the results of the 2023 say on pay vote, which received support ofstockholders representing more than 93% of our outstanding stock. We remain committed to ongoing dialogue withstockholders and other stakeholders to obtain their input on key matters and inform our management and Board aboutthe issues that our stockholders tell us matter most to them.
STOCKHOLDER ENGAGEMENT IN 2023
In line with our commitment to ongoing stockholder engagement, we requested meetings with stockholdersrepresenting more than 50 percent of our outstanding stock and participated in engagement meetings withstockholders representing over 40 percent of our outstanding stock and approximately 80% of our institutionalinvestor base. Members of ConocoPhillips’ management from Investor Relations, Executive Compensation, HumanResources, Legal, and Sustainable Development all participated in stockholder meetings.

TRACK RECORD OF CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT RESPONSIVE TO STOCKHOLDER FEEDBACK
ConocoPhillips has a track record of continuously seeking to evolve our compensation programs to incorporatestockholder feedback, market best practices, and performance and retention considerations. We strive to clarify andsimplify our compensation-related disclosures while providing thorough and meaningful details of our process. Beloware highlights of recent changes to our compensation programs:
•  Effective for the 2024 short-term incentive program and PSP,  the Financial metric will include both a relative
and absolute measure for Adjusted ROCE to better align payouts with the stockholder experience; payouts willcontinue to be determined on a formulaic basis
•  Effective for the 2023 short-term incentive program, we eliminated relative Total Shareholder Return (but
retained in the long-term program) and increased the weighting of our Financial and Operational measures tofurther strengthen the link between performance of the company and payouts
•  Effective for the 2023 short-term incentive program, we created a separately weighted measure for “Energy
Transition Milestones” which enhances the link between our climate commitments and our executivecompensation programs
•  Effective in 2023, we increased the CEO’s stock ownership guideline from six to eight times salary
•  Effective for the 2022 short-term incentive program, we eliminated positive individual performance adjustments
for NEOs
•  Effective in 2021, the company eliminated all grandfathered tax gross-up benefits under our Change in Control
Severance Plan(1)
•  Effective in 2021, the company strengthened our stock ownership guidelines by no longer counting unvested PSPtarget units toward ownership guidelines while maintaining robust guidelines for NEOs; further, the companydoes not count unexercised stock options towards ownership guidelines
(1)  Executives who became plan participants after the spinoff in 2012 were not eligible for any gross-up payment. The change removes eligibility for any
gross-up payments for executives who were plan participants prior to the spinoff in 2012 and who were previously grandfathered.
2023 STOCKHOLDER PROPOSAL – SHARE RETENTION UNTIL RETIREMENT
For the 2023 Proxy Statement, the Comptroller of the State of New York submitted a proposal asking stockholders tovote in favor of requiring NEOs to retain a significant percentage of shares acquired from equity compensation plansuntil reaching normal retirement age. After evaluating the proposal, the HRCC determined that increasing the CEO’sstock ownership guidelines from six to eight times salary achieved the appropriate balance of being consistent withmarket practices, which enables us to attract and retain executive talent, and having robust ownership guidelines thatalign executive compensation with stockholder interests. During engagements in 2023, stockholders were supportiveof the change made by the HRCC and did not request any additional changes. The proposal failed to receive significantsupport in 2023 with less than 23% of stockholders indicating support for the proposal as submitted by the Comptrollerof the State of New York.

Executing on our Returns-Focused Value Proposition Delivers StrongFinancial and Operational Performance
Throughout 2023, ConocoPhillips demonstrated that we can deliver strong financial and operational performanceconsistent with our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycles while executingagainst our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathwaydemand, deliver competitive returns on and of capital to our stockholders, and achieve our net-zero operationalemissions ambitions.
•  We delivered full year total and Lower 48 record production of 1,826 thousand barrels and 1,067 thousand barrels of oilequivalent per day, respectively, while we continued to enhance our portfolio diversity by opportunistically acquiring theremaining 50% working interest in Surmont, reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska and further progressing ourglobal LNG strategy.
•  We achieved a 17 percent return on capital employed(1) and we delivered competitive returns of capital by distributing
$11 billion to stockholders through our three-tier framework, including $5.6 billion in cash through the ordinary dividendand variable return of cash (“VROC”) and $5.4 billion through share repurchases.
•  We continued to demonstrate our commitment to our net-zero operational emissions ambition by accelerating our GHG
emissions-intensity reduction target through 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60%(2) and we were awarded the Oil & Gas MethanePartnership 2.0 Gold Standard Pathway designation.
We continue to be guided by our SPIRIT Values and remain committed to executing our foundational principles —focusing on peer-leading distributions, maintaining a strong balance sheet, executing disciplined investment, anddemonstrating responsible and reliable ESG performance. Supporting these core principles are our strategic cash flowallocation priorities: (1) invest enough capital to sustain production and pay the existing dividend; (2) grow the dividendannually; (3) maintain ‘A’ credit rating; (4) return greater than 30 percent of cash from operations to stockholders; and(5) make disciplined investments to enhance returns.

Philosophy and Principles of Our ExecutiveCompensation Program
OUR GOALS
Our goals are to attract, retain, and motivate high-quality employees and to maintain high standards of principledleadership so we can responsibly deliver energy to the world and provide sustainable value for our stakeholders, nowand in the future.
OUR PHILOSOPHY — PAY FOR PERFORMANCE
We believe that:
•  Our ability to responsibly deliver energy and provide sustainable value is driven by superior individual performance;
•  A company must offer competitive compensation to attract and retain experienced, talented, and
motivated employees;
•  Employees in leadership roles are motivated to perform at their highest levels when performance-based pay is a
significant portion of their compensation; and
•  The use of judgment by the HRCC plays an important role in establishing increasingly challenging corporate
performance criteria to align executive compensation with company performance.
OUR STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES
To achieve our goals, we implement our philosophy through the following principles:
•  Establish target compensation levels that are competitive with the companies that we compete against for
executive talent;
•  Create a strong link between executive pay and successful execution of our strategy;
•  Encourage prudent risk-taking by our executives;
•  Motivate performance using compensation to reward specific individual accomplishments;
•  Retain talented individuals;
•  Maintain flexibility to better respond to the cyclical energy industry; and
•  Integrate all elements of compensation into a comprehensive package that aligns goals, efforts, and results
throughout the organization.

Components of Executive Compensation
The four primary elements of our executive compensation program are designed to provide a target total value forcompensation that is competitive with our peers and attracts and retains the talented executives necessary to manage alarge and complex organization such as ConocoPhillips.
Base Salary
Base salary is a central component of compensation for all of our salaried employees. Management, with the assistanceof Mercer, its outside compensation consultant, thoroughly examines the scope and complexity of executive jobsthroughout ConocoPhillips and benchmarks the competitive compensation practices for such jobs. As a result of thiswork, management has developed a compensation structure that assigns all positions to specific salary grades. Forour executives, the base salary midpoint increases as the salary grade increases, but at a lesser rate than the overalltarget incentive compensation percentages increase. The result is a higher percentage of at-risk compensation as anexecutive’s salary grade rises.
We set base salaries to be competitive within our compensation reference group and, for certain staff positions, Fortune50-150 Industrials, taking into account responsibilities and duties, individual performance, and time in position. See“Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Setting Target Compensation — Compensation Reference Group”beginning on page 79 for a discussion of our benchmarking exercise.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Performance-Based Pay Programs
ANNUAL INCENTIVE
All of our employees throughout the world — including our executives — participate in our annual short-term incentiveprogram, called the Variable Cash Incentive Program (“VCIP”). It is our primary vehicle for recognizing company andindividual performance for the prior year. We believe that having an annual “at risk” compensation element givesemployees a financial stake in the achievement of our business objectives and motivates them to achieve thoseobjectives.
For all employees, the base VCIP award is comprised of corporate performance categories including HSE, Operational,Financial, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones. The HRCC has discretion to adjust base awards upor down depending on individual performance, but the final award, inclusive of any adjustments, may not exceed 200percent of the target. Beginning with the 2022 program, the HRCC eliminated individual performance adjustments inthe short-term incentive program for NEOs.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVES
Our primary long-term incentive compensation programs for executives are the Performance Share Program (“PSP”)and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, which replaced the Stock Option Program effective with equity grantsmade in 2018. The HRCC approved replacing stock options with three-year, time-vested restricted stock units under theExecutive Restricted Stock Unit Program in response to stockholder feedback and to be consistent with market trends.In addition, the HRCC increased the weighting of the long-term incentive award in the form of performance-basedrestricted stock units under the PSP from 60 percent to 65 percent and assigned a weight of 35 percent to theExecutive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in these programs.
PERFORMANCE SHARE PROGRAM
The PSP rewards executives based on ConocoPhillips’ performance over a three-year period. Each year, the HRCCestablishes performance metrics for a new three-year performance period. Thus, performance results in any given yearare considered in three overlapping performance periods. We believe the use of a multi-year performance period helpsto focus management on longer-term results. PSP award targets are set in shares at the beginning of the performanceperiod, and actual cash payouts, based on the HRCC’s evaluation of performance, are calculated using our stock valueafter the conclusion of the three-year performance period. Thus, the value of the performance shares is tied to stockprice performance throughout the performance period.
Targets for participants whose salary grades are changed during a performance period are prorated to align incentivelevels with the individual’s changing level of responsibility. Changes in salary not accompanied by a change in salarygrade do not affect the targets. The targets for the CEO are set annually by the HRCC.
The award is calculated on a formulaic basis using a relative TSR metric and a relative Financial metric, with respectiveweightings of 60 and 40 percent. At the end of the performance period, the final award may not exceed 200 percent ofthe total target award (the initial target award set in restricted stock units, at the beginning of the performance period,together with any promotional awards and reinvested dividend equivalents during the performance period). The finalaward is determined by the HRCC following several detailed reviews of company performance and is based on theHRCC’s evaluation of ConocoPhillips’ formulaic performance relative to the preestablished metrics (discussed under“Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Corporate Performance Criteria” on page 81).

(4)  On October 23, 2023, Chevron Corporation announced a planned acquisition of Hess Corporation. Effective upon the completion of the acquisition only
the combined company (Chevron Corporation) will be retained for any ongoing performance programs.
(5)  Performance peer for PSP 21 and PSP 22 awards only.
(6)  Performance peer for PSP 23 and PSP 24 awards only. Pioneer Natural Resources was added to the performance peer group to better reflect our
significant footprint in the Permian Basin. On October 11, 2023, Exxon Mobil announced a planned acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. Effectiveupon the completion of the acquisition only the combined company (Exxon Mobil) will be retained for any ongoing performance programs.
EXECUTIVE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT PROGRAM
Like the PSP, the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program is designed to reward our executives for long-term shareperformance and encourage executive retention while incentivizing absolute performance that is aligned withstockholder interests. The restricted stock units vest three years following the date of grant, which is competitive withindustry peers.
The combination of the PSP and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, along with our Stock OwnershipGuidelines described under “Executive Compensation Governance — Alignment of Interests — Stock Ownership andHolding Requirements” on page 95, provides a comprehensive package of long-term incentives for our executives thatalign their interests with stockholders.
STOCK OPTION PROGRAM
In response to stockholder feedback and consistent with market trends, the HRCC discontinued the Stock OptionProgram effective with equity grants made in 2018 and substituted the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program.The practice under the Stock Option Program was to set option exercise prices no lower than the fair market value ofConocoPhillips stock at the time of the grant. Because an option’s value is derived solely from an increase in our stockprice, options only reward recipients if the value of our stock appreciates. All previously granted and unexercised stockoptions are vested and exercisable and expire 10 years following the grant date.
OFF-CYCLE AWARDS
ConocoPhillips may make awards outside the PSP or the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Currently, off-cycleawards are generally granted to certain incoming executives for one or more of the following reasons: (1) to inducean executive to join ConocoPhillips (occasionally replacing compensation the executive will lose by leaving the prioremployer); (2) to induce an executive of an acquired company to remain with ConocoPhillips for a certain period of timefollowing the acquisition; or (3) to provide a pro rata equity award to an executive who joins ConocoPhillips during anongoing performance period in which the executive is ineligible to participate under the standard PSP or ExecutiveRestricted Stock Unit Program provisions. In these cases, the HRCC has sometimes approved a shorter period forrestrictions on transfers of restricted stock units than those issued under the PSP or Executive Restricted Stock UnitProgram. Any off-cycle awards to Senior Officers must be approved by the HRCC.

Process for Determining Executive Compensation
Our executive compensation programs take into account market-based compensation for executive talent; internal payequity among our employees; corporate, business unit, and individual results; and the talents, skills, and experiencethat each individual executive brings to ConocoPhillips. Our NEOs each serve without an employment agreement.All compensation for these officers is set by the HRCC as described below.
ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
HUMAN RESOURCES AND COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (HRCC)
•  Annually reviews and determines compensation for the CEO and for each of the NEOs.
•  Makes critical decisions on competitive compensation levels, program design, performance targets and associatedpeer groups, corporate and individual performance, and appropriate pay adjustments necessary to reflect short-

•  The HRCC also has sole authority to retain, terminate, and obtain advice and assistance from a compensation
consultant, external legal, accounting, and other advisors and consultants. The HRCC conducts an annual review ofthe HRCC’s independent consultant and has discretion to replace the independent consultant. The HRCC approvesin advance all the work to be done by the independent consultant.
MANAGEMENT
•  ConocoPhillips’ Human Resources department supports the HRCC in the execution of its responsibilities andmanages the development of the materials for each committee meeting, including market data, individual andcompany performance metrics, and compensation recommendations.
•  The CEO considers performance and makes individual recommendations on base salary, annual incentive, andlong-term equity compensation with respect to Senior Officers, including all NEOs other than himself. Theserecommendations are reviewed, discussed, modified, and approved, as appropriate, by the HRCC. No member ofthe management team, including the CEO, has a role in determining his or her own compensation.
COMPENSATION CONSULTANTS
The HRCC retained FW Cook as its independent executive compensation consultant in 2023. Management alsoretained Mercer to provide other consulting services. The consultants compile compensation data, conduct analyses,supplement internal resources for market analysis, and assist in the evaluation of the compensation of the CEO andSenior Officers.
The HRCC considered whether any conflict of interest exists with either FW Cook or Mercer in light of SEC rules. TheHRCC assessed the following factors relating to each consultant in its evaluation:
•  Other services provided to us by the consultant;
•  Fees paid by us as a percentage of the consulting firm’s total revenue;
•  Policies or procedures maintained by the consulting firm that are designed to prevent a conflict of interest;
•  Any business or personal relationships between the individual consultants involved in the engagement and a
member of the HRCC or executive officers; and
•  Any ConocoPhillips stock owned by the individual consultants involved in the engagement.
Both FW Cook and Mercer provided the HRCC with appropriate assurances addressing such factors. Based on thisinformation, the HRCC concluded the work of the consultants did not raise any conflict of interest. The HRCC alsotook into consideration all factors relevant to FW Cook’s independence from management, including those specifiedin Section 303A.05(c) of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, and determined that FW Cook is independent andperforms no other services for ConocoPhillips.
ConocoPhillips is prohibited from employing any FW Cook consultant who worked on our account for a period of oneyear after that individual leaves the employment of the independent consultant.

RISK ASSESSMENT
ConocoPhillips has considered the risks associated with each of its executive broad-based compensation programsand policies. As part of the analysis, we considered the performance measures we use, as well as the differenttypes of compensation, varied performance measurement periods, and extended vesting schedules utilized undereach incentive compensation program. As a result of this review, management concluded the risks arising from ourcompensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ConocoPhillips. Aspart of the Board’s oversight of ConocoPhillips’ risk management programs, the HRCC conducts a similar review withthe assistance of its independent compensation consultant. The HRCC agrees with management’s conclusion that therisks arising from our compensation policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effecton ConocoPhillips.

Setting Target Compensation — Compensation Reference Group
COMPENSATION REFERENCE GROUP AND METHODOLOGY
The HRCC regularly assesses the market competitiveness of our executive compensation programs based on datafrom a compensation reference group. The compensation reference group is currently made up of 11 energy industrycompanies and 11 similarly sized general industry companies that are comparable to ConocoPhillips in terms of size,scope, and compensable factors. The HRCC utilizes a broader reference group that includes non-energy industrycompanies for compensation benchmarking given that ConocoPhillips is uniquely positioned as one of the largestindependent E&P companies based on production and reserves. This reference group, inclusive of general industrycompanies, provides more statistically robust compensation data from companies with similar compensable factors asE&P industry consolidation occurs and is responsive to stockholder feedback. Accordingly, in analyzing the appropriatecomposition of the reference group that would help inform 2023 target compensation decisions, the HRCC consideredthe following criteria:
(1)  Companies with which we compete for business opportunities and executive talent;
(2)  Companies with significant operations and capital investments, medium- and long-term project investment cycles,
and complex global operations;
(3)  Size, including revenues, assets, and market capitalization; and
(4)  Industry focus, particularly companies in the energy industry.
The data is used to assess the competitive market value for executive jobs, assess pay practices, validate targetsfor pay programs, test the compensation strategy, observe trends, and provide a general competitive foundation fordecision-making.

Mercer gathers and performs an analysis of market data for each NEO, comparing each of their individual componentsof compensation, as well as total compensation, to that of the compensation reference group. This competitive analysisconsists of comparing the market data of each of the pay elements and total compensation at the 25th, 50th, and 75thpercentiles of the compensation reference group to compensation for each of our NEOs. Target total compensation foreach NEO is structured to target market competitive pay levels at approximately the 50th percentile in base salary andshort- and long-term incentive opportunities, taking into account roles, responsibilities and duties, experience, individualperformance, and time in position. The HRCC's independent consultant, FW Cook, reviews and independently advises onthe conclusions reached as a result of this benchmarking.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
CEO 2023 Compensation
In reviewing 2023 target compensation for the CEO, the HRCC considered the median target compensation of thecompensation reference group, which was approximately $18 million with a median tenure of approximately fiveyears. Based on this review and considering Mr. Lance’s tenure (11 years), overall performance, the performance ofConocoPhillips, and the relative positioning of target compensation for Mr. Lance as compared to the market median ofthe compensation reference group, the HRCC increased Mr. Lance’s 2023 base salary by 3% effective March 1, 2023,his 2023 short-term incentive target from 160% to 165% and his 2023 long-term incentive target awards by $0.8 million.The increase to his long-term incentive target had no pension impact.
Internal Pay Equity
We believe our compensation structure provides a framework for an equitable compensation ratio among ourexecutives, with higher targets for jobs involving greater duties and responsibilities. Our compensation program isdesigned so that the individual target level rises as salary grade level increases, with the portion of performance-basedcompensation rising as a percentage of total target compensation. The HRCC reviews the compensation of SeniorOfficers periodically to ensure the equitable compensation of officers with similar levels of responsibilities.
Developing Performance Measures
We believe our performance measures appropriately reflect the performance of ConocoPhillips consistent with ourstrategy as an independent E&P company. Specifically, the HRCC has approved a balance of metrics, some thatmeasure performance relative to our peer group, some that measure absolute performance, and some that measureprogress in executing our strategic and energy transition milestones and objectives. We have selected multiple metrics,as described herein, because we believe no single metric is sufficient to capture the performance we are seeking todrive. Moreover, reliance on any metric in isolation is unlikely to promote the well-rounded executive performancenecessary to enable us to achieve long-term success. It is for this reason that metrics are assessed in tandem, ratherthan each with a separate weighting and threshold. The HRCC reassesses performance metrics periodically to confirmthat they remain appropriate.
Setting Increasingly Challenging Targets
Targets for each metric are set in accordance with our rigorous internal budget. The HRCC believes that increasinglychallenging performance metrics best assess ConocoPhillips’ performance relative to its strategy as an independentE&P company. Increasingly challenging targets can mean year-over-year performance target increases for safety,efficiency, emissions reduction, unit cost targets, and margins. However, it can also mean the same or lowerperformance targets, recognizing a changing commodity price environment. For example, delivering flat productiontargets following significant capital and operating cost reductions or establishing production targets below those set inprior years after significant asset dispositions would be considered “increasingly challenging.” Likewise, setting highercost or capital targets above those set in prior years after significant acquisitions or periods of rising inflation would beconsidered “increasingly challenging.”

Corporate Performance Criteria
Individual NEO payouts are determined based on the payout for corporate performance. We use the compensationmetrics described below, as approved by our HRCC, to determine the corporate performance payout. The compensationmetrics support our Triple Mandate, are consistent with our strategic cash flow allocation priorities, and, therefore, arealigned with our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles. See “Executive Compensation —Strategic Alignment” beginning on page 72. The HRCC determines the ultimate payout of our programs based on howwell ConocoPhillips performs against targets set for each of these metrics. The compensation metrics and how theyalign with our strategic priorities and desired outcomes are described in more detail below.

HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL (VCIP ONLY)
Everything we do depends on safely executing our business plans and operating to high standards of HSE stewardship.We view this as our fundamental license to operate. We have a comprehensive HSE program across our entire company,which includes criteria for process and personal safety. We include relative Total Recordable Rate and Process SafetyEvents in our compensation metrics to reinforce our commitment to be an industry leader in HSE, drive continuous HSEimprovement, and provide accountability for HSE at all levels of the organization, including among our senior leaders.
Total Recordable Rate is a measure of the rate of recordable injury cases in a year. Process Safety Events is a measureof the control of process hazards in a facility with the potential to impact people, property, or the environment. Thisincludes the prevention, control, and mitigation of unintentional releases of hazardous material or energy from primarycontainment. We invest significant resources and provide focused attention to continually improve our safety cultureand performance across the entire company.
OPERATIONAL (VCIP ONLY)
As an E&P company, strong operational performance is essential for delivering on our commitments to stockholders.Our Operational metrics include absolute targets for Production, Capital, Operating and Overhead Costs, andOperational Milestones.
Our primary source of revenue and cash flow is the sale of our produced oil and gas. Therefore, we set an annualProduction target, and we measure results against the approved target. Importantly, we tie our annual Production targetto annual targets for Capital, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Operational Milestones. This is designed to ensurethat we do not inadvertently incentivize actions, such as growing at all costs, that are misaligned with our strategicpriorities. Effective capital and operating cost management also helps us achieve a low cost of supply portfolio insupport of our returns-focused strategy. The Operational Milestones and targets are also designed to create alignmentwithin our workforce around delivering business plans while maintaining discipline.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
FINANCIAL (VCIP AND PSP)
The Financial metrics in our compensation programs strongly align with our returns-focused strategy, are core todelivering our value proposition of superior returns through cycles, and strongly correlate to total shareholder returns(“TSR”) and value creation for stockholders. Adjusted ROCE is an important metric for ensuring ConocoPhillips isefficiently allocating capital and is a strong indicator of long-term share price performance. We include Adjusted ROCEin both our VCIP and PSP to ensure that we maintain financial discipline and balance short- and long-term performance.
Our Financial compensation measure includes Adjusted ROCE relative to peers over a one-  and three-year period.Evaluation of our performance relative to peers is designed to provide above or below target payouts based on ourperformance against our performance peer group. These relative metrics are measured from third quarter to thirdquarter for the relevant periods because full-year peer data is not publicly available at the time of the HRCC annualperformance assessment. Therefore, Adjusted ROCE as used for our Financial compensation metrics will differ fromROCE as calculated for other periodic reporting.
For VCIP and PSP, the impact of non-operational results and special items that are unusual or nonrecurring are removedas well as the impact of cash, consistent with ConocoPhillips’ strategy to maintain cash on the balance sheet to ensureadequate liquidity through down cycles. Adjusted ROCE is calculated as follows:
earnings plus or minus special itemsplus after-tax interestexpense plus minority interest
÷
cash adjusted average capital employed(total equity plus total debt less cash andcash equivalents, restricted cash, andshort-term investments)
STRATEGIC MILESTONES (VCIP ONLY)
Delivering on our value proposition requires that we take actions and steward the business in ways that are notexclusively operational or financial in nature. Our Strategic Milestones represent annual actions to progress ourlong-term objectives that position the company to grow and develop over the coming years and decades andthat are aligned to our strategy. These metrics provide a direct link from our stated strategy to metrics in thecompensation programs.
ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES (VCIP ONLY)
Effective with our 2023 short-term incentive program, we created a separately weighted measure for “EnergyTransition Milestones.” These milestones are guided by our Triple Mandate to reliably and responsibly deliver oil andgas production to meet energy transition demand while delivering competitive returns and focusing on achieving ournet-zero operational emissions ambition. Creating a separate metric serves to further enhance the link between ourclimate commitments and our executive compensation programs.
RELATIVE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (PSP ONLY)
We believe our Operational and Financial measures and Strategic and Energy Transition Milestones have a strong,positive correlation to TSR in our sector. Thus, as we pursue these measures, we expect to achieve superior returnsto stockholders. TSR is the best overall indicator of our long-term success. By integrating compensation metricswith strategic priorities, we believe we are strongly aligned with stockholder interests across time periods andthrough cycles.
We believe it is important to include TSR in our PSP because it is the most tangible, visible measure of the value wehave created for stockholders during the relevant period.
TSR represents the percentage change in stock price from the beginning to the end of a performance period, plusthe percentage impact from common stock dividends paid during the performance period assuming dividends arereinvested into the stock. Consistent with market practice, we calculate TSR for compensation purposes based on a20-trading day simple average prior to the beginning of a period and a 20-trading day simple average prior to the end ofthe stated period.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
We measure TSR relative to our performance peer group to mitigate the influence of sector-wide factors, such ascommodity price volatility, on our stock price.
MEASURING PERFORMANCE — PERFORMANCE PEER GROUP
Our performance peer group is used to evaluate relative business results in both our annual incentive and performanceshare programs. This includes both relative TSR and relative Adjusted ROCE. The HRCC believes our performance isbest measured against both large independent E&P companies with diverse portfolios and some of the largest publiclyheld integrated oil and gas companies that we compete against in our business operations. In addition, the S&P 500Total Return Index is included in our performance peer group (for the relative TSR metric only) because the HRCCbelieves that we should be measured against the companies that we compete with for capital in the broader market. Webelieve that our performance peer group is representative of the companies that investors use for relative performancecomparisons. Additionally, the inclusion of the index as a performance peer further aligns executive pay with long-termstockholder interests as we will be required to outperform both industry peers and a market-based index to receive amaximum payout.
The following tables show the performance peer groups that were established for evaluating relative metrics for theperiods indicated.

2023 Executive Compensation Analysisand Results
The following is a discussion and analysis of the decisions the HRCC made regarding our NEOs in 2023.
Base Salary
The HRCC reviews base salary annually for each of the NEOs. The salary adjustment program is determined by annualbenchmarking. Individual salary increases are the result of individual performance, relative position to market, andchanges to salary grade. Base salaries for the CEO and for Messrs. Olds and Macklon and Ms. Rose were increased 3to 8 percent effective March 1, 2023, based on their performance and competitive positioning relative to their peersin the compensation reference group. Effective March 1, 2023, the HRCC approved a promotion, including a 5 percentbase salary increase, for Mr. Bullock reflecting the broad scope of his responsibilities, performance, and competitivepositioning relative to peers in the compensation reference group.
The table below shows the annualized base salary for each NEO as of the date shown:

Performance-Based Programs
Actual awards earned under our performance-based programs can range from zero to 200 percent of the initialaward for our NEOs. In determining performance-based compensation awards for our NEOs for performance periodsconcluding at the end of 2023, the HRCC began by assessing overall company performance. To that end, the HRCCconsidered the performance reviews throughout and after the performance period ended to assess the degree ofdifficulty in achieving absolute performance targets and the extent to which such targets were achieved. The HRCCthen used the percentile-based matrix below to formulaically evaluate the results of the Financial metric (relativeAdjusted ROCE) in the VCIP and PSP and the relative TSR metric in the PSP.

Annual Incentive — Variable Cash Incentive Program (VCIP)
All of our employees are eligible for the VCIP. The VCIP payout for our NEOs is calculated using the following formulawith the maximum VCIP payout capped at 200 percent of target. The HRCC has the sole authority to determine thecorporate performance payout based on its assessment of our performance against our metrics. Beginning with the2022 VCIP, the HRCC eliminated positive individual performance adjustments for the NEOs, and payouts are solelydetermined by the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC.

VCIP CORPORATE PERFORMANCE
We incorporate a balance of metrics into our annual incentive program that align with delivering our valueproposition and maintaining competitiveness versus our performance peer group. Our program includes bothline-of-sight and strategic metrics, as well as both absolute and relative metrics. We do not believe that a singlemetric is sufficient for driving the behaviors or performance we seek. Therefore, we carefully consider and selecta combination of metrics that best ensures accountability across the organization for both short- and longer-termbusiness success. The HRCC routinely reviews and reassesses the VCIP performance metrics and confirm thatthey remain appropriate for driving desired performance outcomes.
In December 2022, the HRCC approved the five corporate performance measures by which it would judgecorporate performance for the 2023 VCIP payout. The corporate measures and assigned weights were: HSE(20%); Operations (30%); Financial (30%); Strategic Milestones (10%); and Energy Transition Milestones (10%).
The HRCC determines the ultimate payout of our programs based on the extent to which ConocoPhillips achievesthe targets established under the five corporate performance measures set forth above. These measuressupport our Triple Mandate and directly correspond to our strategic cash flow allocation priorities, whichsupport our goal to deliver superior returns to stockholders through price cycles.

SETTING TARGETS FOR 2023
The HRCC reviews and approves targets for the performance metrics annually. The process begins with ourrigorous internal budget, which is set each year across the organization and then approved by our Board.For setting VCIP targets, the outputs from the internal budget are reviewed for alignment with the valueproposition, as well as degree of difficulty. The HRCC believes that targets should reflect a reasonable chance ofachievability, but also be challenging. Significant effort is invested to ensure that the metrics and targets reflectboth a desire for continuous improvement and a realistic assessment of changes in the market environment andour portfolio.
For the relative Financial metric, the HRCC established a matrix to inform payout decisions, see page 84. In thecase of HSE, Operations, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones metrics, the HRCC relies on arigorous and transparent review process with management and exercises its judgment based on its knowledgeof the business to assess degree of difficulty and determine the appropriate payout (see “HRCC Review Process”beginning on page 88). The HRCC does not believe either a matrix or a threshold-maximum approach isappropriate for all metrics given the significant volatility of the business in any given year and the influence ofnon-operated activities over which ConocoPhillips has limited control. Having a threshold-maximum approachcould incentivize behaviors that are counter to the best interest of ConocoPhillips and its stockholders. Basedon our 2023 outreach, we believe the majority of stockholders were satisfied with the level of disclosure aroundour process, and we have continued to enhance transparency around our targets and results and have sought tocontinuously improve our disclosures around payout decisions.
Absolute VCIP targets for 2023 were aligned with the production, capital, and operating and overhead externalguidance ConocoPhillips provided externally. See “HRCC Annual Compensation Cycle” on page 78.
The HSE, Operations, Financial, Strategic Milestones, and Energy Transition Milestones targets set by the HRCCare as follows:
HSE
We target top-quartile performance relative to our peers for Total Recordable Rate and absolute continuousimprovement for TRR and for Process Safety Events. We target being an industry leader in HSE in an effortto drive continuous HSE improvement and provide accountability for HSE at all levels of the organization,including among our senior leaders.
OPERATIONS
Production
The target was set at 1,790 MBOED, which was aligned with the guidance provided to the marketplacein 2023. The HRCC considered the target to be increasingly challenging. On an adjusted basis, theProduction target represented 3 percent organic growth as compared to 2022 pro forma production of1,730 MBOED. The HRCC also considered the target to be increasingly challenging when balanced withthe Operating and Overhead Costs target and Capital target.
Capital
The target was set at $11.2 billion, which was consistent with the operating plan outlined to themarketplace in 2023. The Capital target was an increase of approximately 11 percent from full-year2022 capital expenditures, due to increased spend on longer-cycle projects, including PALNG, Willow,NFE and NFS, more than offsetting the absence of 2022 acquisition spend.

Operating and Overhead Costs
The target was set at $8.2 billion, which was consistent with the operating plan outlined to themarketplace in 2023. The Operating and Overhead target was an increase of approximately 6 percentfrom the full year 2022 operating and overhead expenditures due to volume growth and inflation.
Operational Milestones
In the Lower 48, milestones included delivering on Big 3 unconventional development programs aswell as progressing optimization efforts across the basins. In Canada, milestones included transitioningMontney to early development by achieving flowback on Pad 5 and Pad 6, as well as starting upthe second phase of the company’s gas processing facility. Additionally in Canada, milestones forSurmont included achieving first steam on Pad 267. In Alaska, milestones included reaching FID onWillow, subject to regulatory and legal resolutions, and advancing Nuna 3T to AFE approval. In Norway,milestones included mechanically completing the first subsea template and facilities on TommelitenA. In Malaysia, milestones included advancing WL4-00 toward AFF decision and finalizing a strategicpath forward. In China, milestones included achieving Bohai Phase 4B first oil and sanctioning BohaiWindfarm AFE, subject to government approval.
The exploration milestones included executing the Bear-1 exploration well in Alaska. Additionally, weincluded a corporate technology milestone to deliver the first release of nxtgenERP with no loss ofbusiness effectiveness or integrity.
FINANCIAL
Our financial performance is measured according to our relative performance of Adjusted ROCE amongour peers.
STRATEGIC MILESTONES
Our Strategic milestones included:
•  Progressing the LNG business through advancing new PALNG, NFE, and NFS projects, securing several
regasification and offtake agreements, and building out our LNG organization;
•  Implementing action plans for priority E&S risks and tracking progress against mitigations; and
•  Refreshing our DEI strategy globally and identifying how to assess progress on each component of
diversity, equity, and inclusion.
The HRCC believes these targets, which aligned with external guidance provided to the marketplace, wereappropriate and challenging and consistent with ConocoPhillips’ disciplined, returns-focused strategy.
ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES
Our Energy Transition Milestones included:
•  Demonstrating progress against our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition;
•  Achieving an annual GHG emissions intensity aligned with our 2030 target trajectory range(1), including
any updates to the 2030 target;
•  Executing our capital and cost budget for approved MACC projects; and
•  Advancing multiple low carbon opportunities.

HRCC REVIEW PROCESS
After meeting to approve the metrics (as discussed above), the HRCC met four more times with managementto review progress and performance against the approved metrics to determine award payouts under theVCIP. The first and second reviews occurred during 2023 and were designed to provide the HRCC withinformation concerning the ongoing performance of ConocoPhillips. The third review with the HRCC in lateJanuary 2024 focused on the detailed final results for each performance metric relative to the targets, a degreeof difficulty discussion, and an explanation of normalization adjustments when appropriate. The final reviewin mid-February 2024 focused on a summary of the results for each performance metric and deliberation anddetermination of the final payout by the HRCC. This process allows the HRCC to consider results, degree ofdifficulty, and normalization adjustments in one meeting and make informed payout decisions in a separatemeeting. Results for Production, Operating and Overhead Costs, and Capital, as applicable, are normalized toaccount for acquisitions and dispositions (e.g., dispositions of non-strategic assets in the Lower 48), foreignexchange rates, commodity price-related adjustments of actuals to targets and related tax and production-
sharing contract impacts, and items beyond the control of management (e.g., production impacts from naturaldisasters). This allows the HRCC to measure results against targets on a consistent basis and measuremanagement performance so there is no benefit or detriment to executive compensation for these items. Thenormalization adjustments are reviewed by and discussed with the HRCC. The HRCC retains the discretion tomake a positive or negative adjustment to awards based on its determination of appropriate payouts. Beginningwith the 2022 VCIP, the HRCC eliminated positive individual adjustments for the NEOs, and payouts are solelydetermined by the corporate performance payout approved by the HRCC.
2023 RESULTS
HSE (ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE) – 20% weighting
2023 was a challenging year for HSE. Although we had several successes, there were also opportunities forimprovement. We remained in the top quartile among our peers for TRR, and we experienced fewer processsafety events as compared to 2022. We also experienced zero spills greater than 100 barrels. Although weremained an industry leader among our peers, we had an increase in serious incidents, including one fatality.This serves as a reminder to keep focusing on surpassing the bar that we continuously raise. The HRCCbelieves that the resulting 85% payout reflects ConocoPhillips’ overall HSE performance.
OPERATIONS (ABSOLUTE) – 30% weighting
Our operations performance resulted in adjusted Production of 1,813 MBOED, 1 percent above our target of1,790 MBOED. Production performance was strong across our portfolio, driven by Lower 48 well performanceand accelerated timing. Our Capital spending of $11.1 billion, adjusted for approved scope changes, came in1 percent below our 2023 VCIP target of $11.2 billion. Our Operating and Overhead Costs came in 4 percentabove the $8.2 billion target, reaching $8.6 billion, due to higher non-operated workover activity, highervolumes and commodity–driven inflation. We also achieved or exceeded all of our Operational Milestones(see “Operational Milestones” on page 87) with the exception of the nxtgenERP milestone, where we madethe decision to delay releases to complete additional testing to address potential impacts to businesseffectiveness. In considering the results of these interdependent operations metrics collectively, the degreeof difficulty, and the company’s strong execution of operating plans, the HRCC determined a slightly above-
target payout (125%) was warranted.

FINANCIAL (RELATIVE) – 30% weighting
Our Adjusted ROCE relative to peers was in the 58th percentile, which was driven by our operationalperformance and success across our global portfolio. The HRCC followed the matrix on page 84 to determinethe payout (122%).
STRATEGIC MILESTONES (ABSOLUTE) – 10% weighting
We far exceeded expectations on all of the Strategic Milestones. We significantly progressed the LNGbusiness through advancing new PALNG, NFE and NFS projects, secured regasification and offtakeagreements and staffed key roles. We identified and implemented action plans for risk mitigations. Weremained focused on DEI, completing the development of educational DEI materials, and leveraging DEIPerspectives survey data to refresh our DEI strategy. In addition, we identified how to assess progress oneach component of diversity, equity, and inclusion. The HRCC determined a maximum payout (200%) waswarranted given ConocoPhillips’ exceptional performance in achieving the Strategic Milestones.
ENERGY TRANSITION MILESTONES (ABSOLUTE) – 10% weighting
We successfully demonstrated meaningful progress against our Plan for the Net-Zero Energy Transition,including by increasing our target trajectory range for 2030 from 40-50% to 50-60% of gross operatedemissions intensity reduction using a 2016 baseline. We also achieved an annual GHG emissions intensityaligned with our 2030 target trajectory range. In addition, we completed our approved MACC projectswithin the allotted capital and cost budget. We also advanced multiple low carbon opportunities. The HRCCdetermined that an above target payout (190%) was appropriate considering our demonstrated commitmentto progressing towards our energy transition goals.
These results reflect a strong year for ConocoPhillips. We achieved or exceeded our target for almost everymetric and showed our commitment and ability to deliver strong financial and operational performanceacross our global portfolio. The HRCC believes that the resulting 130% corporate performance payoutreflects ConocoPhillips’ overall strong performance in 2023.

(1)  Operating and overhead costs include production and operating expenses; selling, general, and administrative expenses; and controllable explorationgeneral and administrative expenses, geological and geophysical, and lease rental and other expenses, adjusted to remove the impact of specialitems that are unusual or nonrecurring. Operating and Overhead Costs results and the absolute metric results for Capital are adjusted to normalize, asapplicable, for acquisitions and dispositions, foreign exchange rates, price, and related tax and production-sharing contract impacts, and items beyondthe control of management. Actual operating and overhead costs and capital for 2023 were $8.6B and $11.2B, respectively.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Long-Term Incentive: Performance Share Program (PSP)
The PSP is designed to motivate senior leadership worldwide to execute their duties in a way that not only achievesConocoPhillips’ approved strategy but also closely aligns senior leadership with long-term stockholder interests.Approximately 60 of our current employees participate in the PSP. Grants made to NEOs in 2023 for PSP 23 aresummarized in note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. Performance measures and peers for all ongoingprograms can be found on page 76.
PSP 21 PERFORMANCEIn 2021, the HRCC approved performance metrics for the PSP performance period running from January 2021through December 2023. The PSP uses staggered three-year performance periods, with PSP 21 using twocorporate performance measures: (1) relative Total Shareholder Return, which is weighted 60%; and (2) relativeFinancial, which is weighted 40%.
The HRCC considered ConocoPhillips’ overall performance based on the PSP 21 performance measures setforth above, which, similar to VCIP, directly correspond to our strategic priorities and support our goal to deliversuperior returns to stockholders through price cycles. See “Executive Overview — Executive Compensation —Strategic Alignment” on page 72 and “Process for Determining Executive Compensation — Corporate PerformanceCriteria” beginning on page 81.
HRCC REVIEW PROCESS
In determining award payouts under PSP 21, the HRCC met several times with management throughout theperformance period to review progress and performance against the approved metrics. The review with theHRCC in late January 2024 focused on the detailed final results for each performance metric. The final reviewin mid-February 2024 focused on a summary of the results for each performance metric and deliberation anddetermination of the final payout by the HRCC. This process allows the HRCC to consider results in one meetingand make informed payout decisions in a separate meeting.
2021 – 2023 RESULTS
TSR – 60% weighting
Three-year TSR of 46% resulted in a relative ranking of 4th in TSR, putting us in the 71st percentile(160% payout per the matrix) in TSR compared to our performance peer group based over the three-yearperformance period on the 20-day average methodology, outperforming the independent and integratedperformance peer average and the overall peer average, including significantly outperforming the S&P 500.The HRCC then followed the matrix on page 84 in making its determination of the payout for this relativeTSR metric.
FINANCIAL – 40% weighting
We finished 4th in Adjusted ROCE (63rd percentile) relative to our performance peers over the three-yearperformance period (137% payout per the matrix). The HRCC followed the matrix on page 84 in making itsdetermination of the payout for the relative Financial metric.
The HRCC believes ConocoPhillips is executing the right strategy and recognizes the leadership andcommitment our executives demonstrated during the performance period. The HRCC believes that a 151%formulaic payout reflects ConocoPhillips’ overall strong performance during the 2021-2023 performance period.

Other Executive Compensation and Benefits
Other Compensation and Personal Benefits
In addition to our four primary compensation components, we provide our NEOs a limited number of benefits asdescribed below. Some benefits, such as executive life insurance coverage and nonqualified benefit plans, are providedfor competitive reasons. Other benefits are designed primarily to promote a healthy work/life balance, to provideopportunities for developing business relationships, and to personalize our social responsibility programs.
Comprehensive Security Program — Because our executives face personal safety risks in their roles as representativesof a global E&P company, our Board has adopted a comprehensive security program for our executives.
Personal Entertainment — ConocoPhillips executives participate in community, university, and philanthropicorganizations at the request of the company. We also purchase tickets to various cultural, charitable, civic,entertainment, and sporting events for business development and relationship-building purposes, as well as to maintainour involvement in communities where we operate. Occasionally, our employees, including our executives, makepersonal use of tickets that would not otherwise be used for business purposes. We believe these tickets offer anopportunity to expand our networks at a very low or no incremental cost to ConocoPhillips.
Tax Gross-Ups — Certain of the personal benefits received by our executives are deemed by the Internal RevenueService to be taxable income to the individual. When we determine that such income is incurred for purposes moreproperly characterized as company business than personal benefit, we provide additional payments to the executiveto reimburse the cost of including the item in the executive’s taxable income. Most often, these tax gross-up paymentsare provided for travel by a family member or other personal guest to attend a meeting or function at our request infurtherance of company business, such as Board meetings, company-sponsored events, and industry and associationmeetings where spouses or other guests are expected to attend.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Tax and Financial Planning Services — We provide our NEOs with certain tax, estate, and financial planning servicesup to $15,000 plus any travel–related expenses incurred by the advisor when meeting with an executive. The benefitis provided while serving as an executive and for up to six months following retirement from the company. We do notprovide a tax gross-up for these benefits.
Executive Life Insurance — We provide life insurance policies and death benefits for all of our U.S.-based salariedemployees (at no cost to the employee) with a face value approximately equal to the employee’s annual salary. For eachof our executives under the ConocoPhillips benefits program, we maintain an additional life insurance policy (at no costto the executive) with a value approximately equal to the executive’s annual salary. In addition to these two plans, wealso provide our executives the option of purchasing group variable universal life insurance or term life insurance inan amount up to eight times their respective annual salaries. We believe that making additional insurance available forpurchase at their own expense is valued by our executives and can be provided at no cost to ConocoPhillips.
Defined Contribution Plans — In addition to the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan, which is our qualified defined contributionplan for U.S.-based employees, we maintain the nonqualified defined contribution plans listed below for our executives.These plans allow deferred amounts to grow tax-free until distributed, while enabling ConocoPhillips to use the moneyfor the duration of the deferral period for general corporate purposes. These types of plans are common among ourcompetitors, and we believe the lack of such plans would put ConocoPhillips at a disadvantage in attracting andretaining talented executives.
•  Voluntary Deferred Compensation Plans — The purpose of our voluntary nonqualified deferred compensation plansis to allow executives to defer a portion of their salary and incentive compensation so that such amounts are notimmediately taxable.
•  Make-Up Plans — The purpose of our nonqualified defined contribution make-up plans is to provide benefits that an
executive would otherwise lose due to limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code on high-income participantsin qualified plans.
Additional information on these plans is provided under Nonqualified Deferred Compensation beginning on page 107.
Defined Benefit Plans — In addition to the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan, which is our qualified defined benefit planfor U.S.-based employees, we also maintain nonqualified defined benefit plans for our executives. The primary purposeof these plans is to provide benefits that an executive would otherwise lose due to limitations imposed by the InternalRevenue Code on high-income participants in qualified plans. The U.S. nonqualified defined benefit plan availableto our NEOs is the Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (“KESRP”). This type of plan is common among ourcompetitors and we believe the lack of such a plan would put ConocoPhillips at a disadvantage in attracting andretaining talented executives. Effective January 1, 2019, the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan was closed to new hiresand rehires who will instead receive an enhanced benefit under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and a related make-upplan. Additional information on the KESRP is provided under Pension Benefits beginning on page 105.
Severance Plans and Changes in Control
We maintain plans to address severance of our executives in certain circumstances as described under ExecutiveSeverance and Changes in Control beginning on page 109. Plans of this nature are common within the industry. Our plansare designed to aid ConocoPhillips in attracting and retaining executives. Under each of our severance and changein control severance plans, the executive must terminate from service with ConocoPhillips to receive severance pay.Excise tax gross-up benefits are not available under these plans.
Vesting of awards under the PSP, Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, and Stock Option Program that areassumed by an acquirer will accelerate only upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a qualifyingtermination of employment of the employee (usually called a “double trigger”).
Broadly Available Plans
Our NEOs are eligible to participate in the same basic benefits package as our other U.S. salaried employees. Thisincludes expatriate benefits; relocation services; medical, dental, vision, life, and accident plans; health savingsaccounts; and flexible spending arrangements for health care and dependent care expenses.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Executive Compensation Governance
Alignment of Interests — Stock Ownership and Holding Requirements
We place a premium on aligning the interests of our executives with those of our stockholders. All executives aresubject to stock ownership guidelines, with an eight times base salary guideline for the CEO (increased from six timeseffective in 2023) and three to four times base salary guideline for other NEOs. Executives have five years from the datethey become subject to the Stock Ownership Guidelines to comply. Holdings counted toward the guidelines include:(1) shares of stock owned individually, jointly, or in trusts controlled by the employee; (2) restricted stock and restrictedstock units; (3) shares owned in qualified savings or stock ownership plans, whether vested or not; and (4) stock orunits in nonqualified deferred compensation plans, whether vested or not. Holdings not counted toward the guidelinesinclude PSP target units and unexercised stock options. Employees subject to the guidelines who have not reachedthe required level of stock ownership are expected to hold shares received upon vesting or earn-out of restrictedstock, restricted stock units (net of shares for taxes), and shares received upon exercise of stock options (net of sharestendered or withheld for payment of exercise price and shares for taxes), so they meet their requirement in a timelymanner. The multiple of equity held by each of our NEOs currently exceeds our established guidelines.
Clawback Policy
The HRCC has approved a Clawback Policy providing that ConocoPhillips will recoup any incentive compensation(cash or equity) paid or payable to any executive to the extent such recoupment is required or contemplated by theprovisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, or any other applicable law or listing standards. To comply with NYSE listing standards and final SEC rulesunder the Dodd-Frank Act, the HRCC adopted a restated Clawback Policy effective October 2, 2023. The ClawbackPolicy requires the Board to recoup incentive compensation (cash or equity) paid in the event of certain businesscircumstances, including a financial restatement. The policy operates in addition to provisions already contained inour award documents for the PSP, the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, the Stock Option Program, and othercompensation programs using company equity. Those documents permit the HRCC or other granting committee tosuspend rights to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of awards already requested, or cancel awards granted if anexecutive engages in any activity we determine is detrimental to ConocoPhillips, including acts of misconduct (such asembezzlement, fraud, theft, or disclosure of confidential information) or other acts that harm our business, reputation, oremployees, as well as misconduct that results in ConocoPhillips having to prepare an accounting restatement. To date,no NEOs have been subject to any clawbacks.
Anti-Pledging and Anti-Hedging
Pursuant to our insider trading policy, ConocoPhillips directors, officers and all other employees are prohibited frompledging company stock, holding company stock in a margin account, or entering into hedging transactions, includingthe use of financial instruments such as prepaid variable forwards, equity swaps, collars, and exchange funds. Thispolicy, together with the Stock Ownership Guidelines discussed above, helps ensure that our NEOs and other SeniorOfficers remain subject to the risks, as well as the rewards, of stock ownership.
Equity Grant Practices
When the HRCC awards Performance Share Units, Executive Restricted Stock Units, or other equity grants to the NEOs,the fair market value of the units or the exercise price of the options or other equity is determined based on an averageof the stock’s high and low prices on the date of grant (or the preceding business day, if the markets are closed on thedate of grant). For purposes of granting such awards, we use an average of the closing prices on the 10 trading dayspreceding the date of grant. Grants of Performance Share Units and Executive Restricted Stock Units are generallymade at the HRCC’s February meeting (the date of which is determined at least a year in advance) or, in the case of newhires, on the date of commencement of employment or the date of HRCC approval, whichever is later.

Compensation Discussion and Analysis
Statutory and Regulatory Considerations
In designing, implementing, and determining compensation under our compensation programs, we act in accordancewith our compensation philosophy and believe that attracting, retaining, and motivating our employees withcompensation programs that support long-term value creation is in the best interests of our stockholders. However, wealso take into account the various tax, accounting, and disclosure rules associated with various forms of compensation.We have reviewed and considered the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the InternalRevenue Code and designed deferred compensation programs with the intent that they comply with or are exempt fromSection 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. We generally seek to preserve tax deductions for executive compensationwhere possible and commensurate with our practice of aligning pay with performance. Nonetheless, ConocoPhillips hasawarded compensation that is not fully tax deductible when the HRCC believes that doing so is in the best interest ofour stockholders, and ConocoPhillips reserves the right to do so in the future.

(1)
Includes any amounts that were voluntarily deferred under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan (“KEDCP”).
(2)  Our primary short-term incentive compensation arrangement for employees (the Variable Cash Incentive Program or “VCIP”) has performance measures
established by the HRCC and communicated to employees, including the NEOs, at a time when the outcome of the performance is substantially uncertainfor the 2023 performance period. The HRCC must determine the level of achievement under such performance measures before there is any payout toNEOs. Because of this process, amounts paid under the VCIP are shown in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the table, rather than theBonus column.
(3)  Amounts shown represent the aggregate grant date fair value of awards made during each of the years indicated under the Performance Share
Program (“PSP”) and the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program as determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. See the “Employee Benefit Plans” section of Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form10-K for a discussion of the relevant assumptions used in this determination. For the awards granted for PSP 23 and 2023 Executive RSUs, the grantdate fair value was $112.50, but as noted in the Equity Grant Practices outlined on page 95 awards are granted using the average of the closing priceson the 10 trading days preceding the date of grant ($112.658). The difference between these values can increase or decrease the reported amountsfrom year to year even if target compensation does not change. A detailed breakdown of 2023 awards in the Stock Awards column of the SummaryCompensation Table is on the following page:

The amounts shown for awards from the PSP relate to the respective three-year performance periods that began in each of the years presented.Performance periods under the PSP generally are three years. As a new performance period has begun each year since the program commenced,there are three overlapping performance periods ongoing at any time.
The amounts shown for 2021 include the full initial target for PSP 21 for the January 2021–December 2023 performance period, as well as anyincremental targets set during 2021 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. Bullock and Mr. Macklon werepromoted in 2021). The amounts shown for 2022 include the full initial target for PSP 22 for the January 2022–December 2024 performance period,as well as any incremental targets set during 2022 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. Olds was promoted in2022). The amounts shown for 2023 include the full initial target for PSP 23 for the January 2023–December 2025 performance period, as well as anyincremental targets set during 2023 with regard to any ongoing performance period as a result of promotions (Mr. Bullock was promoted in 2023).
Amounts are shown at target for each year because it is most probable at the setting of the target for the applicable performance periods that targetswill be achieved. If payout was made at maximum levels for company performance the amounts shown would double from the targets shown, althoughthe value of the actual payout would be dependent upon the stock price and accrued dividend equivalent units at the time of the payout. If payout wasmade at minimum levels, the amounts would be reduced to zero. No adjustment is made to the target shown for prior years based upon any change inprobability after the target is set. Changes to targets resulting from promotion or demotion of a NEO are shown as awards in the year of the promotionor demotion, even though the awards may relate to a program period that began in an earlier year.
The grant date fair values of the target awards for PSP 21 (January 2021-December 2023) granted in 2021 appear in the table in 2021, and any incrementaltarget awards as a result of a promotion appear in the year in which they were granted. Actual payouts with regard to the targets for PSP 21 wereapproved by the HRCC at its February 2024 meeting. Pursuant to that approval, payouts were made in February 2024 (with values shown at fair marketvalue on the date of settlement) to the NEOs as follows: Mr. Lance, 339,301 units valued at $37,453,741; Mr. Bullock, 106,856 units valued at $11,795,300;Ms. Rose, 73,017 units valued at $8,059,982; Mr. Olds, 65,048 units valued at $7,180,323 ; and Mr. Macklon, 75,201 units valued at $8,301,062. Theseamounts do not appear in the Summary Compensation Table. Under the terms and conditions of the awards, participants were able to make electionsprior to the beginning of the performance period to defer all or a portion of the award value into the KEDCP. See the section on Nonqualified DeferredCompensation beginning on page 107 for further information.
For PSPs beginning in 2012 and later settlement will be made in cash rather than unrestricted shares. For target awards for program periods beginningin 2013 and later, the vesting period ends shortly after the end of the performance period, except that in the cases of termination due to death, layoff,or retirement, or after disability or a change in control, the vesting period ends upon the occurrence of the exceptional termination event althoughthe timing of settlement remains unchanged. For programs beginning prior to 2013, the employee may have elected, prior to the beginning of theperformance period, to defer the lapsing of restrictions until after separation. For PSPs beginning in 2013 and later, the employee may elect, prior tothe beginning of the performance period, to have some or all of the settlement value deferred into the KEDCP.
(4)  Includes amounts paid under the VCIP and VCIP amounts that were voluntarily deferred to the KEDCP. See the section on Nonqualified Deferred
Compensation beginning on page 107 for further information. See also note 2 on the previous page.
(5)  Amounts represent the actuarial increase in the present value of the NEO’s benefits under all pension plans maintained by ConocoPhillips determinedusing interest rate, discount rate, and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those used in ConocoPhillips’ financial statements. Primarily as aresult of such actuarial factors, the present value of the benefit to Mr. Lance decreased from 2022 to 2023 by $287,376. In accordance with the SECrules that do not permit the inclusion of values less than $0 for this column, an amount of zero is shown on the previous page.
Interest Rates and Discount Rates —
Interest rate assumption changes have a significant impact on the pension values, with periods of higher interest rates having the effect of decreasingthe actuarial values reported and vice versa. The discount rate assumptions and discount periods from the assumed retirement age to current age usedin determining the present value may also have an impact on the pension values, with higher discount rates having the effect of decreased actuarialvalues reported and vice versa, and shorter discount periods having the effect of increased actuarial values reported and vice versa.

Final Average Pay and Service Credit —
The years of service credited and increases to compensation are also factors in the benefit accrual. Each additional year of service credit and payincreases will generally result in an increase in the actuarial values reported. This only applies to Messrs. Lance, Bullock, and Olds who are the onlyNEOs who participate in a final average earnings title of ConocoPhillips’ U.S. pension plans. See Pension Benefits beginning on page 105 of this ProxyStatement for further information.
(6)  As discussed in “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement, ConocoPhillips provides its executives with anumber of compensation and benefit arrangements. The table below reflects amounts earned in 2023 under those arrangements. We have excludedthe cost of benefits that are generally available to our U.S.-based salaried employees, such as our medical, dental, vision, life, and accident plans,disability, and health savings and flexible spending account arrangements. All of our NEOs are U.S.-based salaried employees. All Other Compensationincludes the following amounts, which were determined using actual cost paid by ConocoPhillips unless otherwise noted:

(a)  ConocoPhillips’ Comprehensive Security Program requires that the CEO, Mr. Lance, fly on company aircraft unless the Global Security Departmentdetermines that other arrangements represent an acceptable risk. All other NEOs are permitted to use the aircraft for preapproved personal travel.Amounts represent the approximate aggregate incremental cost to ConocoPhillips for personal use of the aircraft, including travel for any familymember or personal guest. Approximate aggregate incremental cost has been determined by calculating the variable costs for each aircraft duringthe year, dividing that amount by the total number of miles flown by that aircraft, and multiplying the result by the miles flown for personal use duringthe year. However, where there were identifiable costs related to a particular trip — such as fuel, airport landing fees or food and lodging for aircraftpersonnel who remained at the location of the personal trip — those amounts are separately determined and included in the table above. The amountsshown include incremental costs associated with flights to the hangar or other locations without passengers (commonly referred to as “deadhead”flights) arising from the non-business use of the aircraft by a NEO. Beginning in 2021, Mr. Lance has entered into aviation lease agreements with thecompany under which reimbursement, subject to FAA limitations, is provided for certain flights which are personal in nature. Amounts in the tableabove reflect aggregate incremental cost net of reimbursements. Lease reimbursements are allocated to the flight to which they relate but may bepaid in a different year due to lease administration.
(b)  ConocoPhillips executives participate in community, university, and philanthropic organizations at the request of the company. In some cases, companyaircraft are used to support these activities as well as other activities not integrally related to the performance of the executive’s duties. When theseactivities are considered as not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive’s duties, we include the aggregate incremental costto ConocoPhillips in this column. The same guidelines for determining approximate aggregate incremental cost as discussed in note (a) are used indetermining these amounts.
(c)  ConocoPhillips maintains a Matching Gift Program, under which certain gifts by employees to qualified educational or charitable institutions are
matched. For executives, the program matches up to $10,000 with regard to each program year. Administration of the program can cause us to paymore than the limit in a single fiscal year due to a lag in processing claims.
(d)  The amounts in this column represent other perquisites and personal benefits including the cost of presentations made to employees and their spousesat Company meetings or events, reimbursements for the cost of spousal and other guests attendance at such meetings or events, and the aggregateincremental cost of any other personal benefits or perquisites not integrally and directly related to the performance of the executive’s duties arisingfrom such presentations, meetings, or events, primarily food, drink and transportation. Also includes any aggregate incremental cost of enhanced homesecurity, transportation security, and other protection services provided under our Comprehensive Security Program. As part of his duties and in additionto working in the Houston headquarters of the company, Mr. Olds is required to work in the company’s Midland, Texas office which serves as a strategicoperational hub for its Permian Basin assets. Approximately 840 employees are based in this office. While working in Midland, Mr. Olds lived in a company-
purchased house and drove a company-leased automobile. The amount shown for Mr. Olds includes the company’s actual cost of the house for the daysused by Mr. Olds and the company’s actual cost of leasing the automobile for the days used by Mr. Olds.
(e)  The amounts shown reflect the cost of professional advice related to tax, estate and financial planning. The maximum benefit in 2023 was $15,000
plus any travel-related expenses incurred by the advisor when meeting with an executive. No tax gross-up is provided for these costs.
(f)  Mr. Bullock was previously assigned in Singapore and Mr. Macklon was previously on the U.K. payroll assigned in the U.S. These amounts reflect netexpatriate benefits under our standard policies for such service outside of the employee’s home country, and these amounts include payments forincreased tax costs related to such expatriate assignments and benefits. Amounts shown in the table above also reflect amended tax equalization andsimilar payments under our expatriate services policies that were made to and from, or on behalf of, the NEO that were paid or received during 2023,but apply to earnings of prior years, but which were unknown or not capable of being estimated with any reasonable degree of accuracy in prior years.These amounts are returned to ConocoPhillips when they are known or received through the tax reporting and filing process. Not included in the tableare amounts less than $0 that primarily relate to tax amounts returned to ConocoPhillips in the normal course of the expatriate tax protection processthat may relate to a prior period. The amount noted for Mr. Macklon would have been negative $29,112.

(g)  The amounts shown reflect the aggregate incremental cost of premiums paid by ConocoPhillips for executive group life insurance (coverage equal
to two times annual salary) versus the cost of basic life insurance provided to non-executive employees (coverage equal to annual salary). In addition,certain employees, including the NEOs, are eligible to purchase group variable universal life insurance policies at no incremental cost to ConocoPhillips.
(h)  The amounts shown are for payments by ConocoPhillips relating to certain taxes incurred by the employee. These taxes arise primarily when ConocoPhillipsrequests family members or other guests to accompany the employee to a function, and, as a result, the employee is deemed to make a personal use ofcompany assets (for example, when a spouse accompanies an employee on a company aircraft). ConocoPhillips believes such expenses are appropriatelycharacterized as a business expense, and, if the employee has imputed income in accordance with the applicable tax laws, ConocoPhillips will generallyreimburse any increased tax costs.
(i)  Under the terms of its tax-qualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes matching contributions and nonelective allocations to the accounts
of its eligible employees, including the NEOs.
(j)  Under the terms of its nonqualified defined contribution plans, ConocoPhillips makes contributions to the accounts of its eligible employees, including
the NEOs. See the narrative, table, and notes to the Nonqualified Deferred Compensation section beginning on page 107 for further information.
Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table
The Grants of Plan-Based Awards Table shows participation by the NEOs in the incentive compensation arrangementsdescribed below.
The columns under the heading Estimated Future Payouts Under Non-Equity Incentive Plan Awards show informationregarding VCIP. The amounts shown in the table are those applicable to the 2023 program year, using a minimum of zeroand a maximum of 200 percent of VCIP target for each participant; the amounts shown do not represent actual payoutsfor that program year. Actual payouts for the 2023 program year were made in February 2024 and are shown in theSummary Compensation Table on page 98 under the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column. Awards are eligibleto be voluntarily deferred under the KEDCP.
The columns under the heading Estimated Future Payouts Under Equity Incentive Plan Awards show information regardingPSP. The amounts shown in the table are those set for 2023 compensation tied to the 2023 through 2025 program periodand any promotional grants for previous performance periods and do not represent actual payouts for that program year.These awards accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional restrictedstock units and paid upon the applicable vesting of the underlying award. Dividend equivalents are not paid at preferentialrates and are credited at the same time dividends are paid on common stock. Awards settled in cash are eligible to bevoluntarily deferred under the KEDCP. For the 2023 program year under the PSP, the HRCC set the targets and grantedawards at the regularly scheduled February 2023 meeting of the HRCC.
The All Other Stock Awards column reflects awards granted under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. TheExecutive Restricted Stock Unit Program awards shown were granted on the same day the target was approved, vestat the end of a three-year period, and accrue dividend equivalents that, during the performance period, are reinvestedin additional restricted stock units and settle in stock upon the applicable vesting of the underlying award. Dividendequivalents are not paid at preferential rates and are credited at the same time dividends are paid on common stock.For the 2023 program year under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program, the HRCC set the targets and grantedawards at the regularly scheduled February 2023 meeting of the HRCC.

(1)  The grant date shown is the date on which the HRCC approved the target awards or, in the case of prorated promotional awards under the PSP, the effective
date of the promotion. In the case of Mr. Bullock, his promotion was effective March 1, 2023.
(2)  Threshold and maximum awards are based on the program provisions under VCIP. Actual awards earned can range from zero to 200 percent of the targetawards for corporate performance inclusive of negative discretionary adjustments for individual performance. Amounts reflect estimated cash payoutsunder VCIP after the close of the performance period at the threshold, target, and maximum level of performance.
The estimated amounts are calculated based on the applicable annual target and base salary for each NEO in effect for the 2023 performance period,including any salary increases during the year. While the program terms would also automatically adjust for salary decreases, these are not reflected inthe table above. If threshold levels of performance are not met, then the payout can be zero. The HRCC also retains the discretionary authority to makenegative individual performance adjustments to awards to NEOs under VCIP. Actual payouts under VCIP for 2023 are based on actual base salariesearned in 2023 and are reflected in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation column of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98.
(3)  Threshold and maximum awards under the PSP are based on the program provisions. Actual awards earned under the PSP can range from zero to 200percent of the awards. Ms. Rose and Mr. Olds received an additional 10 percent initial award for PSP 23 (2023-2025) in recognition of their differentialperformance in 2022.
(4)  This reflects awards for the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Executive Restricted Stock Unit awards can only be adjusted downward.
(5)  For equity incentive plan awards, these amounts represent the grant date fair value at target level under PSP as determined pursuant to FASB ASC
Topic 718 and reflected in the Stock Awards column in the Summary Compensation Table on page 98. Actual value realized upon vesting of the PSP orExecutive Restricted Stock Unit awards depends on market prices at the time of settlement for such awards. See the “Employee Benefit Plans” sectionof Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ConocoPhillips’ 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the relevantassumptions used in this determination.

(1)  All options shown in the table have a maximum term for exercise of ten years from the grant date. Under certain circumstances, the terms for exercisemay be shorter, and, in certain circumstances, the options may be forfeited and cancelled. All awards shown in the table have associated restrictions on transferability.
(2)  The options shown in this column vested and became exercisable in 2020 or prior years (although under certain termination circumstances, the options
may still be forfeited). Options became exercisable in one-third increments on the first, second, and third anniversaries of the grant date.
(3)  Stock awards made to the NEOs in 2023 include: (a) long-term incentive awards under the PSP; or (b) long-term time-vested awards under the
Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program. Stock awards shown in the columns entitled Number of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested andMarket Value of Shares or Units of Stock That Have Not Vested continue to have restrictions upon transferability. Stock awards shown reflect the closingprice of ConocoPhillips common stock ($116.07), as reported on the NYSE, on December 29, 2023, the last trading day of 2023. The number of sharesor units shown is rounded to the nearest whole share, but the related value is based on the actual number of shares (including fractional shares), withaggregate value rounded to the nearest dollar.
  Amounts include PSP awards for the performance period that ended in December 2023 (PSP 21), shown at target. At its February 2024, meeting, the HRCCapproved final payout levels for the NEOs with regard to that performance period, as follows: Mr. Lance, 339,301 units; Mr. Bullock, 106,856 units; Ms. Rose,73,017 units; Mr. Olds, 65,048 units; and Mr. Macklon, 75,201 units; see note 3 of the Summary Compensation Table. Under the PSP, stock awards are madein the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) or restricted stock, the former having been used in the most recent awards. The terms and conditions of bothare substantially the same, requiring restriction on transferability until separation from employment, although for performance periods beginning after2008 and before 2013, restrictions will lapse five years from the anniversary of the grant date unless the employee has elected prior to the beginning of theperformance period to defer the lapsing of such restrictions until separation from employment. For performance periods beginning after 2012, restrictionswill lapse three years after the grant, and awards will be settled in cash. Except in cases where the five-year provision applies, forfeiture is expected tooccur if the separation is not the result of death, disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service,or after a change in control, although the HRCC has the authority to waive forfeiture. Restricted stock awards have voting rights and pay dividends. RSUawards have no voting rights. RSUs granted under PSP prior to 2018 pay dividend equivalents, but no dividend equivalents are paid or accrued for awardsmade under the PSP until after the applicable performance period has ended. RSUs granted under the PSP in 2018 and later accrue dividend equivalentsthat, during the performance period, are reinvested in additional RSUs. Dividends or dividend equivalents are not paid at preferential rates, and dividendequivalents are paid at the same time as dividends on common stock. Restricted stock held by the NEOs prior to November 17, 2001, was converted toRSUs prior to the completion of the merger of Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Company, with the original restrictions still in place. Awards for ongoingperformance periods under PSP 22 (January 2022 –December 2024) and PSP 23 (January 2023 –December 2025)) are shown at target levels in thecolumns entitled Equity Incentive Plan Awards: Number of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested, and Equity Incentive Plan Awards:Market or Payout Value of Unearned Shares, Units or Other Rights That Have Not Vested. There is no assurance that these awards will be granted at, below,or above target after the end of the relevant performance periods, as the determination of whether to make an actual grant and the amount of any actualgrant for NEOs is within the discretion of the HRCC.

Executive Compensation Tables
Amounts also include Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program awards granted in February 2021, 2022, and 2023. Under the Executive Restricted StockUnit Program, stock awards are made in the form of RSUs. The terms and conditions of those units require restriction on transferability, which lapsethree years from the anniversary of the grant date. Forfeiture is expected to occur at separation from service if the separation is not the result of death,disability, layoff, or retirement after the executive has reached the age of 55 with five years of service, or after a change in control, although the HRCChas the authority to waive forfeiture. Upon lapse of restrictions, settlement is made in stock. RSU awards have no voting rights. Dividend equivalents, ifany, on RSUs held are reinvested in additional RSUs. Dividend equivalents are paid at the same time and the same rate as dividends on common stock,not at a preferential rate. Awards under the Executive Restricted Stock Unit Program are shown in the columns entitled Number of Shares or Units ofStock That Have Not Vested.
Amounts also include restricted stock and RSU awards granted with respect to prior periods. The plans and programs under which such grants weremade provide that awards made in the form of restricted stock and RSUs be held in such form until the recipient retires (with respect to awards madebefore 2009) or the earlier of eight years or retirement (with respect to awards made from 2009 through 2012), with the possible election to hold untilretirement, or three years (with regard to awards made in 2013 or later), with payouts for the last to be made in cash (unless voluntarily deferred to anaccount in the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan). If such awards immediately vested upon completion of the relevant performance period asis more typical for restricted stock programs, the amounts reflected in this column would be zero for awards made in years prior to 2012.

Pension Benefits
Our defined benefit pension plan for U.S. based employees is the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (“CPRP”). The CPRPis intended to be tax-qualified under section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Our NEOs also participate in thenonqualified ConocoPhillips Key Employee Supplemental Retirement Plan (“KESRP”).
The CPRP consists of multiple titles with different terms, each corresponding to a different pension formula. NEOs areonly eligible to participate in one title at any time but may have frozen benefits under one or more other titles. Benefitsare identified by title in the table below, and all NEOs are vested in their benefits under the CPRP. Each title allowsfor payment in the form of several annuity types or a single lump sum, but all of the options are considered actuariallyequivalent. Effective January 1, 2019, the CPRP was closed to additional benefit accrual for new hires and rehires whoinstead are eligible for an enhanced benefit under the ConocoPhillips Savings Plan and a related make-up plan.
Normal retirement for all of the CPRP titles is defined as the later of age 65 or the employment termination date, but participants in Title II may receive their vested benefits upon termination of employment at any age. Under Title I, earlyretirement can occur at age 55 with five years of service. Under Title IV, early retirement can occur at age 50 with tenyears of service. Under Title I, early retirement benefits are unreduced for benefits that commence at or after age 60, butare reduced by five percent per year (prorated by month) for each year before age 60 that benefits are paid. Under TitleIV, early retirement benefits are unreduced for benefits that commence at or after age 60, but are reduced by five percentper year (prorated by month) for each year from age 50 to age 57 that benefits are paid before age 60 and four percentper year (prorated by month) for each year from age 57 that benefits are paid before age 60. Messrs. Lance, Bullock, andOlds were eligible for early retirement at the end of 2023 under the terms of Title I or Title IV, as applicable.
The annual pension benefit under Title I and Title IV is an amount payable in the form of a single life annuity beginningat normal or early retirement equal to 1.6% multiplied by the participant’s pension compensation multiplied by years ofcredited service, minus a Social Security benefit offset equal to 1.5% multiplied by the participant’s annual primary SocialSecurity benefit multiplied by years of credited service. For Title I, pension compensation is calculated using the threehighest consecutive years in the last ten years before retirement. For Title IV, pension compensation is calculated using thehigher of the highest consecutive 36- months of compensation or the highest nonconsecutive three years of compensation.

Executive Compensation Tables
Eligible pension compensation is limited to the annual maximum permitted under the Internal Revenue Code andgenerally includes salary and annual incentive compensation and other items (such as overtime) that are not applicableto or are not material for our NEOs. Under Title I, if an executive receives layoff benefits, eligible pension compensationincludes annualized salary for the year of layoff, rather than actual salary, and years of credited service are increasedby the layoff benefit period.
Pension benefits under Title II are based on monthly pay and interest credits to a notional cash balance account. Paycredits are equal to a percentage of eligible pension compensation as described above. Participants whose combinedage and years of service total less than 44 receive a 6% pay credit, those whose combined age and years of servicetotal 44 through 65 receive a 7% pay credit, and those whose combined age and years of service total 66 or morereceive a 9% pay credit.
Mr. Macklon began participating in Title II of CPRP when he transferred to the U.S. payroll. Previously while he was on theU.K. payroll, he participated in the ConocoPhillips Pension Plan (the “U.K. Plan”). The U.K. Plan is a U.K. registered planwith His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”). Mr. Macklon has a deferred, vested benefit under the noncontributoryportion of the U.K. Plan. Under applicable provisions of the U.K. Plan, a member is entitled to receive full benefits uponattainment of normal pension age (60 in the case of Mr. Macklon) subsequent to termination. Early retirement may occurafter reaching age 55. Early retirement benefits are unreduced on and after age 60, but are actuarially reduced eachmonth before age 60 that benefits are paid. In general, annual pension benefits under the U.K. Plan are calculated as theproduct of 1.75% of final pensionable salary multiplied by years of credited service. Final pensionable salary is generallybasic annual salary plus pensionable allowances earned in the 12 months before active membership in the U.K. Plan ends.The U.K. Plan allows participants to choose between taking a full annuity or a reduced annuity plus a lump sum allowanceof up to 25 percent of the value of the benefit (capped at the greater of £268,275, or 25% of the protected lifetimeallowance in effect when the allowance was prospectively eliminated in 2023). Both choices are actuarially equivalent.
The KESRP is designed to replace benefits that would otherwise not be received due to certain voluntary reductionsof compensation under the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Plan of ConocoPhillips (“KEDCP”) and to limitationscontained in the Internal Revenue Code that apply to the CPRP. The KESRP determines a benefit without regard to suchlimits, and then reduces that benefit by the amount of benefit payable from the CPRP. Thus, in operation the combinedbenefits payable from the related plans for an eligible employee equal the benefit that would have been paid if therehad been no KEDCP deferrals or limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. For participants in Title I of the CPRP,the KESRP pension compensation is calculated using the three highest annual amounts for salary and VCIP in the lastten calendar years before retirement plus the year of retirement. Applicable pension compensation for participants inTitle II and Title IV of the CPRP, is calculated on the same basis as for the CPRP. Benefits under the KESRP are generallypaid in a single lump sum at the later of age 55 or six months after separation from service. When payment is made,interest at then-current six-month Treasury-bill rates will be credited on any delayed benefits. Distribution may also bemade upon a determination of death or disability. Each of the NEOs who are eligible for benefits in the KESRP is vested.
Benefits due under the KESRP are paid from ConocoPhillips’ general assets, although we also maintain grantor truststhat may be used to pay such benefits. The trusts and the funds held in them are assets of ConocoPhillips. In the event ofbankruptcy or insolvency of the company, trust assets would be held for the benefit of the company’s general creditors,and participants would be unsecured general creditors.
For participants in the U.K. Plan, there is a plan similar to the KESRP, known as the ConocoPhillips Unfunded PensionPlan (“U.K Unfunded Plan”), which operates on the same principles but with respect to limits imposed through HMRCon registered plans like the U.K. Plan. Mr. Macklon is a participant in the U.K. Unfunded Plan with regard to the timehe worked in the U.K. from September 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016, at which time he transferred to the U.S. payroll(Mr. Macklon was a participant in the U.K. Plan prior to September 1, 2013). Mr. Macklon is vested in his benefit under theU.K. Unfunded Plan, and such benefit is payable when he attains 55 years of age in the form of a lump sum, or series oflump sums payable over a five- or ten-year period.

(1)  Mr. Lance was previously an employee of ARCO Alaska, which was acquired by Phillips Petroleum Company in 2000. Mr. Lance’s Title I benefitis calculated by including his 16 years of service with ARCO but then reducing the resulting benefit by amounts payable by the BP RetirementAccumulation Plan which remains liable for his benefits accumulated while working for ARCO Alaska. This benefit including ARCO service and theoffset is payable because it exceeds the pension otherwise payable taking into account only ConocoPhillips service (and without the BP RetirementAccumulation Plan offset).
(2)  Ms. Rose became an employee of ConocoPhillips on September 4, 2018. Under Title II, and related provisions in the KESRP, Ms. Rose received pay credits
equal to seven percent of her pension compensation in 2023 because her combined age and years of service was 62.
(3)  Mr. Macklon became an employee of ConocoPhillips on September 2, 1991. Under Title II, and related provisions in the KESRP, Mr. Macklon received pay
credits equal to 9 percent of his pension compensation in 2023 because his combined age and years of service exceed 65.
Nonqualified Deferred Compensation
Our NEOs participate in two nonqualified deferred compensation plans, the Key Employee Deferred Compensation Planof ConocoPhillips (“KEDCP”) and the Defined Contribution Make-Up Plan of ConocoPhillips (“DCMP”).
The KEDCP permits participants to defer up to 50% of base salary, 100% of VCIP and 100% of cash settled PSP awards forperformance periods ending in 2015 or later. Each of the NEOs is eligible to participate in, and is fully vested in, the KEDCP.Under the KEDCP, participants may elect for payment of deferred amounts to begin one(a) to five years after separationfrom service or on a specified date.(b) Payments may be received in a single lump sum payment or in annual, semiannual, or quarterly installment payments over a period of one to 15 years.
The DCMP is a nonqualified restoration plan under which ConocoPhillips makes certain employer contributions thatcannot be made in the qualified ConocoPhillips Savings Plan (“CPSP”), a defined contribution 401(k) plan, due to certainvoluntary reductions of compensation under the KEDCP or due to compensation limitations imposed by the InternalRevenue Code. Employees make no contributions to the DCMP, and each of the NEOs is fully vested in the DCMP. Underthe DCMP, participants may elect for payment of deferred amounts to begin one(a) to five years after separation fromservice. Payments may be received in a single lump sum payment or in annual, semiannual, or quarterly payments over aperiod of one to 15 years.
(a)  Different distribution rules applied to amounts deferred and vested prior to 2005.  For these amounts payment could begin as early as immediately
following separation from service and certain changes to distribution elections are permitted.  For amounts deferred under an election made prior to2020, payments could begin as early as six months following separation from service.
(b)  A date certain payment election is not permitted for salary earned before 2015.

Executive Compensation Tables
Each participant directs investments of the notional accounts representing deferrals under KEDCP and DCMP.Participants may make changes in the notional investments at any time.
Because each participant chooses the notional investment fund for deferred amounts and may change allocations,the return on the investment will depend on how well each underlying fund performs during the period the participantchose it as an investment vehicle. The aggregate performance of such investment vehicle is reflected in theNonqualified Deferred Compensation Table under the column Aggregate Earnings in Last Fiscal Year.
Benefits due under each of the plans discussed above are paid from ConocoPhillips’ general assets, although we alsomaintain grantor trusts that may be used to pay benefits under the plans. The trusts and the funds held in them areassets of ConocoPhillips. In the event of bankruptcy or insolvency of the company, trust assets would be held for thebenefit of the company’s general creditors, and participants would be unsecured general creditors.

(1)  A variety of notional investments are available to participants in the KEDCP and DCMP. As of December 31, 2023, there were a total of 82 notionalinvestment options, 17 of which mirrored those available in ConocoPhillips’ primary tax-qualified defined contribution plan for employees (theConocoPhillips Savings Plan, a 401(k) plan) and 65 of which mirrored other mutual fund options approved by an administrator designated by the relevantplan. As market-based investments, none of these provide above market returns.
(2)  Reflects any deferrals by the NEO under the KEDCP in 2023.
(3)  Reflects contributions by ConocoPhillips under the DCMP relating to eligible compensation earned in 2023 (included in the All Other Compensationcolumn of the Summary Compensation Table on page 98 for 2023). The following amounts were contributed in January 2024, relating to companycontributions under the DCMP for 2023 service: for Mr. Lance, $43,775; for Mr. Bullock, $25,325; for Ms. Rose, $23,800; for Mr. Olds, $21,264; and forMr. Macklon, $22,751. In addition, contributions by ConocoPhillips under the DCMP in earlier years (included in the All Other Compensation column ofthe Summary Compensation Table for those respective years) were as follows: in 2022 for Mr. Lance, $165,700; for Mr. Bullock, $77,827; for Ms. Rose,$73,317; for Mr. Olds, $54,680; for Mr. Macklon, $65,225; in 2021 for Mr. Lance, $133,125; for Mr. Bullock, $64,958; for Ms. Rose, $58,497; for Mr.Macklon, $55,569.

Executive Severance and Changes in Control
Salary and other compensation for our NEOs is set by the HRCC, as described in the “Compensation Discussion andAnalysis” beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. These officers may participate in ConocoPhillips’ employeebenefit plans and programs for which they are eligible, in accordance with their terms. The amounts earned by theNEOs for 2023 appear in the various Executive Compensation Tables beginning on page 98 of this Proxy Statement.
After separating from service each of our NEOs is expected to receive amounts earned while employed unless theexecutive voluntarily resigns prior to becoming retirement-eligible or is terminated for cause. Such amounts include:
•  VCIP compensation earned during the fiscal year;
•  Grants pursuant to the PSP for the most-recently completed performance period and ongoing performance periods
in which the executive participated for at least one year;
•  Previously granted restricted stock and restricted stock units;
•  Vested stock option grants under the Stock Option Program;
•  Amounts contributed and vested under our defined contribution plans; and
•  Amounts accrued and vested under our retirement plans.
While normal retirement age under our benefit plans is 65, early retirement provisions allow benefits at earlier agesif vesting requirements are met, as discussed in the sections of this Proxy Statement titled Pension Benefits andNonqualified Deferred Compensation. For our compensation programs (VCIP, Stock Option Program, Executive RSUProgram, and PSP), early retirement is generally defined to be termination at or after the age of 55 with five yearsof service. As of December 31, 2023, Messrs. Lance and Bullock and Ms. Rose had met the early retirement criteria.Messrs. Macklon and Olds, who were under the age of 55, and had not met the early retirement criteria at such date.
In addition, specific severance arrangements for executive officers, including the NEOs, are provided under twoseverance plans: (1) the ConocoPhillips Executive Severance Plan (“CPESP”), which is available to a limited numberof senior executives; and (2) the ConocoPhillips Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan (“CICSP”), which isalso available to a limited number of senior executives but only on or following change in control. These arrangementsare described below. Executives are not entitled to participate in both plans as a result of a single event. For example,executives receiving benefits under the CICSP would not be entitled to benefits potentially payable under the CPESPrelating to the event giving rise to benefits under the CICSP.

Executive Compensation Tables
ConocoPhillips Executive Severance Plan
The CPESP covers executives in salary grades generally corresponding to vice president and higher and is incorporatedby reference to Exhibit 10.47 to the Annual Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021;File No. 001-32395. Under the CPESP, if ConocoPhillips terminates a plan participant other than for cause, as definedin the plan, then upon executing a general release of liability and, if requested, an agreement not to compete withConocoPhillips, the participant will be entitled to:
•  A lump-sum cash payment equal to one-and-a-half or two times the sum of the employee’s base salary and current
target VCIP award;
•  For executives actively participating in the ConocoPhillips Retirement Plan (CPRP) and ConocoPhillips Key Employee
Supplemental Retirement Plan (KESRP), a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value of the increase in pensionbenefits that would result from the crediting of an additional one-and-a-half or two years to the employee’s number ofyears of age and service under the applicable defined benefit pension formula under the plans;
•  A lump-sum cash payment equal to ConocoPhillips’ cost of certain welfare benefits for an additional one-and-a-half
or two years;
•  Continued eligibility for a pro rata portion of the annual VCIP for the year of termination; and
•  Treatment as a layoff under our various compensation and equity programs. Generally, layoff treatment will allow fullor partial vesting of awards previously made and continued eligibility under ongoing ConocoPhillips programs. Thus,Executive RSU awards would vest partially (for grants 6-12 months before the layoff) or fully (for grants more than 12 months before the layoff), and the executive would remain eligible for a pro rata proportion of awards attributableto ongoing performance periods under the PSP in which the executive had participated for at least one year.
ConocoPhillips may amend or terminate the CPESP at any time. Amounts payable under the CPESP will be offset by anypayments or benefits that are payable to the severed employee under any other plan, policy, or program of ConocoPhillipsrelating to severance, and amounts may also be reduced in the event of willful and bad faith conduct demonstrablyinjurious to ConocoPhillips, monetarily or otherwise, or, if required by law to be “clawed back,” such as may be the case incertain circumstances under the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy.
ConocoPhillips Key Employee Change in Control Severance Plan
The CICSP covers executives in salary grades generally corresponding to vice president and higher and is incorporated byreference to Exhibit 10.20.1 to the Annual Report of ConocoPhillips on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021; FileNo. 001-32395. Under the CICSP, if within two years after a “change in control” of ConocoPhillips, a participant is terminatedby ConocoPhillips other than for cause, or by the participant for good reason (as such terms are defined in the plan), uponexecuting a general release of liability, the participant will be entitled to:
•  A lump-sum cash payment equal to two or three times the sum of the employee’s base salary and the higher of current
target VCIP compensation or the previous two years’ average VCIP compensation;
•  For executives actively participating in the CPRP and KESRP, a lump-sum cash payment equal to the present value ofthe increase in pension benefits that would result from crediting an additional two or three years to the employee’snumber of years of age and service under the applicable defined benefit pension formula under the plans;
•  A lump-sum cash payment equal to ConocoPhillips’ cost of certain welfare benefits for an additional two or three
years; and
•  Continued eligibility for a pro rata portion of the annual VCIP compensation for the year of termination.
Excise tax gross-up benefits are not available under the CICSP.
Upon a change in control, awards that an acquirer assumes or substitutes will be subject to accelerated vesting onlyfollowing both the change in control and a qualifying termination of employment. A qualifying termination of employmentincludes involuntary termination not-for-cause or voluntary termination for good reason. Participants will continue to beable to exercise stock options for their remaining terms (up to 10 years from the date of grant).

Executive Compensation Tables
After a change in control, the CICSP may not be amended or terminated if such amendment would be adverse to theinterests of any eligible employee, without the employee’s written consent. Amounts payable under the plan will beoffset by any payments or benefits that are payable to the severed employee under any other plan, policy, or programof ConocoPhillips relating to severance, and amounts may also be reduced in the event of willful and bad faith conductdemonstrably injurious to ConocoPhillips, monetarily or otherwise, or if required by law to be “clawed back,” such asmay be the case in certain circumstances under the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy.
Quantification of Severance Payments
After separating from service each of our NEOs is expected to receive amounts earned during their period of employmentunless they voluntarily resign prior to becoming retirement-eligible or are terminated for-cause. The following tablesreflect the amount of incremental compensation payable in excess of the items listed above to each of our NEOs in theevent of involuntary not-for-cause termination, termination following a change in control (“CIC”) (either involuntarilywithout cause or for good reason), and in the event of the death or disability of the executive. The amounts shown belowassume that such termination was effective as of December 31, 2023, and thus include amounts earned through suchtime, and are estimates of the amounts that would be paid out to the executives upon their termination. Amounts relatedto Health and Welfare benefits are based on current ConocoPhillips benefit programs. The actual amounts to be paidout can only be determined at the time of an executive’s separation from ConocoPhillips. In the event of a for-causetermination, the HRCC can suspend the right to exercise, refuse to honor the exercise of awards already requested, or cancel awards granted if an NEO engages in any activity determined to be detrimental to ConocoPhillips. In addition,the NEO’s incentive compensation is subject to the ConocoPhillips Clawback Policy (see page 95 for more information).

As discussed in the narrative preceding the tables above, the amounts shown indicate the difference in compensationarising from the stated type of termination in comparison to a voluntary resignation. A NEO who voluntarily resigns beforereaching the retirement age and service eligibility threshold contained in those equity awards and compensation programs(generally age 55 with 5 years of service) would not earn awards for ongoing performance periods under the VCIP, the PSP,the Executive RSU Program, or the Stock Option Program (as applicable), and would lose prior awards under the PSP andthe Executive RSU Program (or other restricted stock or RSUs) and stock options. For a NEO who has reached retirementeligibility under those programs, a voluntary resignation would be deemed a retirement, and thus would not typically result in loss of those awards. However, before the awards are delivered as cash or stock (including upon the exercise of anoption), the awards remain at risk, even for a NEO who has reached retirement eligibility. If ConocoPhillips were to invokethe detrimental activity clause, amounts that would normally be paid to a retirement-eligible NEO in connection with avoluntary resignation would instead be forfeited.

Executive Compensation Tables
*  Notes Applicable to All Termination Tables — Benefits that would be available generally to all or substantially all salaried employees on the U.S. payroll
are not included in the amounts shown on the previous page. In preparing the tables, we made the following assumptions:
•  Base Salary — In the event of an involuntary not-for-cause termination not related to a change in control (“regular involuntary termination”), the
amount reflects two times base salary. In the event of an involuntary not-for-cause or good reason termination related to a change in control (“CICtermination”), the amount reflects three times base salary.
•  Short-Term Incentives — In the event of a regular involuntary termination, the amount reflects two times the current VCIP target. In the event of a CICtermination, the amount reflects three times the current VCIP target or three times the average of the prior two VCIP payouts, whichever is greater.
•  Variable Cash Incentive Program — In the event of a regular involuntary termination or a CIC termination, the amount reflects the employee’s pro
rata current VCIP target. Targets for VCIP are for a full year and are pro rata for the NEOs based on time spent in their respective positions.
•  PSP and RSUs — For the performance periods related to PSP, amounts for the January 2021 – December 2023 period reflect actual payout amounts
that were awarded in February 2024, except in the event of a CIC termination, the amounts reflect the higher of target or actual payout, as theaward cannot be reduced following a change in control. Amounts for other ongoing PSP performance periods are shown at target, including anyadjustments for promotion or demotion made since the target awards were granted. For awards under the Executive RSU Program, amounts reflectactual units granted. For restricted stock units awarded under PSP and Executive RSU Program, amounts reflect the closing price of ConocoPhillipscommon stock on December 29, 2023 (the last trading day of 2023), as reported on the NYSE ($116.07).
•
Incremental Retirement Values — For all NEOs, the amounts reflect the single sum, discounted to a present value, of the increment due to anadditional two years of age and service with associated pension compensation in the event of a regular involuntary termination (three years in theevent of a CIC termination), regardless of whether the value is provided directly through a defined benefit plan or through the relevant severance plan.

CEO Pay Ratio
ConocoPhillips’ compensation and benefits philosophy and the overall structure of our compensation and benefitprograms are designed to reward all employees who contribute to our success. We strive to ensure the compensation of every employee reflects their talents, skills, responsibilities, and experience and is competitive within our peer group.Compensation and benefits are benchmarked and set to be market-competitive in the employees’ home payroll country.Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ConocoPhillips is required to calculate and disclose the totalcompensation paid to its median employee, as well as the ratio of total compensation paid to the median employee ascompared to the total compensation paid to the CEO. The paragraphs that follow describe our methodology and theresulting CEO pay ratio.
The ratio of pay of the CEO compared to that of the median employee was approximately 101 to one in 2023. The annual totalcompensation of the CEO was $20,789,282. The estimated median of the annual total compensation of all ConocoPhillipsemployees other than the CEO, as represented by the annual total compensation of a median employee, was $205,547.The compensation of the CEO and the median employee were determined using the same rules we followed in preparingthe Summary Compensation Table on page 98, except the compensation of the CEO and median employee were adjusted toinclude nondiscriminatory health and welfare benefits totaling $18,609 and $16,764, respectively.
ConocoPhillips had approximately 10,045 employees worldwide (including intermittent and temporary employees) asof the determination date (December 31, 2023). To identify the “median employee,” we excluded employees from sixcountries, representing in total approximately 2.3 percent, or 233 employees worldwide. After excluding such employeesand the CEO, we determined the pay ratio using the remaining approximately 9,811 employees. The chart below showsthe countries from which employees were excluded and the approximate number of employees from each such country.
Payroll Country Excluded
Number of Employees Excluded
Malaysia
China
Singapore
Qatar
Libya
Japan






For the remaining employees, we used a consistently applied compensation measure that management believesreasonably reflects the annual compensation of employees and includes elements of compensation distributed widelyamong employees. Those elements were base salary, overtime, annual incentive compensation (VCIP) at target, equityawards, and certain country-specific allowances. We used data as of December 31, 2023, to identify ConocoPhillipsemployees and to determine the consistently applied compensation measure for those employees. Data not denominatedin U.S. dollars was converted to U.S. dollars using an average monthly conversion rate for each denomination during 2023.Data came from ConocoPhillips’ payroll records. We did not make any adjustments to the data to account for differencesin cost of living in any of the countries in which we have employees.
The SEC rules for identifying the median employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employee’s annual totalcompensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonableestimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. Accordingly, the pay ratio reported by othercompanies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employmentand compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates, and assumptions incalculating their own pay ratios.

Pay Versus Performance
Under rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ConocoPhillips is required to calculate and disclose in a tabularformat the “Compensation Actually Paid” (“CAP”) to the CEO and average CAP to all other NEOs. The rules also requireConocoPhillips to disclose in the table the most important other financial performance measure that is measured overthe most recently completed year and that is used by the company to link company performance and compensation(as reflected in CAP) to the NEOs for that year. We have determined that one-year relative Adjusted ROCE used forpurposes of evaluating the VCIP payout (see “Measuring Performance — Performance Peer Group” on page 83) is suchmeasure for 2023. Compensation decisions at ConocoPhillips are made in accordance with the philosophy and processdescribed in the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis” beginning on page 66 of this Proxy Statement. CAP is asupplemental measure defined by rules adopted pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act and does not necessarily reflect thevalue actually realized by our executives. CAP does not replace the performance measures or philosophy and strategyof compensation-setting discussed in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis (see pages 66-96).

The amount shown in 2022 is the cumulative value of that hypothetical investment (with alldividends reinvested) as of December 30, 2022 (the last trading day in 2022). The amount shown in 2023 is the cumulative value of that hypotheticalinvestment (with all dividends reinvested) as of December 29, 2023 (the last trading day in 2023). For this purpose and for all years shown in thetable, our performance peer group consists of APA Corporation, Chevron Corporation, Devon Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., ExxonMobilCorporation, Hess Corporation, Occidental Petroleum Corporation, and Pioneer Natural Resources (see “Measuring Performance — Performance PeerGroup” on page 83 for a description of how we select our performance peer group), and Peer Group TSR is weighted according to each peer’s stockmarket capitalization at the beginning of each annual period. While TSR for our peer group includes the S&P 500 Total Return Index for purposes ofcertain compensation decisions as discussed in “Measuring Performance — Performance Peer Group” on page 83, in accordance with SEC regulationsthe S&P 500 Total Return Index is not included in Peer Group TSR as shown in the table above. In October 2020, Chevron Corporation acquired NobleEnergy, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, Noble Energy, Inc. was a member of our performance peer group, but after the acquisition, we retained only thecombined company for the entire period so that Noble Energy, Inc. effectively ceased to be a member of the peer group retroactive to January 1, 2020.In 2023, we updated our performance peer group, removing Marathon Oil Corporation and adding Pioneer, to better align with our business and marketcapitalization. If we had not made these changes, the cumulative peer group TSR shown in the table above would have been $66.50 for 2020, $105.36for 2021, $183.13 for 2022, and $167.11 for 2023.

Note: As discussed under “Components of Executive Compensation — Performance-Based Pay Programs” on page 75, theHRCC evaluates performance for purposes of PSP payouts using relative TSR and relative Adjusted ROCE measured overa three-year performance period because a multi-year performance period helps to focus management on longer-termresults. Performance-based equity grants under the PSP are the largest individual component of target compensationfor the NEOs (see “Philosophy and Principles of our Executive Compensation Program — Pay for Performance” on page 73).One-year relative Adjusted ROCE is used for purposes of evaluating VCIP payouts for 2020-2023 (see “Process forDetermining Executive Compensation — Financial (VCIP and PSP)” on page 82), and was selected for comparison becauseit complies with SEC guidance that indicates multi-year performance measures should not be used in the Tabular List ofPerformance Measures or as the company-selected measure in the Pay Versus Performance Table.
For purposes of this chart, relative Adjusted ROCE is calculated as described in footnote (7) on page 118.

Stockholder Proposals
We expect Items 4 – 5 to be presented by stockholders at the Annual Meeting. Following SEC rules, other than minorformatting changes, we are reprinting the stockholder proposals and supporting statements, including any graphics,as they were submitted to us. We take no responsibility for them. Upon oral or written request to the Secretary at theaddress listed under How to Reach Our Corporate Secretary on page 129, we will provide the shareholdings (to ourcompany’s knowledge) of the proponents of any stockholder proposal presented at the Annual Meeting.
Item 4: Stockholder Proposal — SimpleMajority Vote
Kenneth Steiner, 14 Stoner Ave., 2M, Great Neck, NY 11021, has notified ConocoPhillips that he intends to presentthe following proposal at the Annual Meeting. Mr. Steiner has indicated that he holds the requisite number of sharesof ConocoPhillips common stock in accordance with Rule 14a-8 requirements.
What am I Voting On?
Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:
Proposal 4 – Simple Majority Vote
Shareholders request that our board take each step necessary so that each voting requirement in our charter andbylaws (that is explicit or implicit due to default to state law) that calls for a greater than simple majority vote bereplaced by a requirement for a majority of the votes cast for and against applicable proposals, or a simple majority incompliance with applicable laws. If necessary this means the closest standard to a majority of the votes cast for andagainst such proposals consistent with applicable laws. This includes making the necessary changes in plain English.
Shareholders are willing to pay a premium for shares of companies that have excellent corporate governance.Supermajority voting requirements have been found to be one of 6 entrenching mechanisms that are negativelyrelated to company performance according to “What Matters in Corporate Governance” by Lucien Bebchuck,Alma Cohen and Allen Ferrell of the Harvard Law School. Supermajority requirements are used to block initiativessupported by most shareowners but opposed by a status quo management.
This proposal topic won from 74% to 88% support at Weyerhaeuser, Alcoa, Waste Management, Goldman Sachs,FirstEnergy, McGraw-Hill and Macy’s. These votes would have been higher than 74% to 88% if more shareholdershad access to independent proxy voting advice. This proposal topic also received overwhelming 98%-support each atthe 2023 annual meetings of American Airlines (AAL) and The Carlyle Group (CG).
This proposal topic won 99% ConocoPhillips support as a shareholder proposal at the 2021 annual meeting. The nextstep was to get binding shareholder approval as a Board of Directors proposal which required 80% approval fromevery last share of ConocoPhillips stock. The outcome was a greatly disappointing narrow failure as the BOD proposalreceived “only” 79% approval at the 2022 COP annual meeting.

Item 4: Stockholder Proposal — Simple Majority Vote
If ConocoPhillips Lead Director Robert Niblock had made a small effort to get an extra 1% shareholder vote this proposaltopic would have been approved in 2022. This narrow failure is evidence that Mr. Niblock does not give priority to the bestinterests of shareholders and should thus be replaced as Lead Director. It will now take at least until 2025 to adopt thisproposal topic, with its 99% ConocoPhillips shareholder approval, that could have been easily adopted in 2022.
Please vote yes:Simple Majority Vote – Proposal 4
What vote is required to approve this proposal?
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented byproxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
WHAT DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND?
Our Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws impose heightened voting requirements for a number of core governanceitems, including “supermajority voting requirements” to amend sections of such documents. The Board believes thatthere are advantages and disadvantages of maintaining the current voting requirements, and there are also advantagesand disadvantages to eliminating them. Accordingly, the Board will support the stockholder proposal and, providedthere is sufficient stockholder support, take steps to implement the proposal in the future.

Item 5: Stockholder Proposal — Revisit PayIncentives for GHG Emission Reductions
National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), located at 107 Park Washington Court, Falls Church, Virginia 22046,has notified ConocoPhillips that they intend to present the following proposal at the Annual Meeting. NLPChas indicated that it holds the requisite number of shares of ConocoPhillips common stock in accordance withRule 14a-8 requirements.
What am I Voting On?
Stockholders are being asked to vote on the following resolution:
Whereas: The “scientific consensus”1 2 claims anthropogenically-driven climate change will result in catastrophicimpacts to the environment, to the planet, and to humans. However, research increasingly shows worst-casescenarios are unlikely, and the potential consequences of carbon dioxide emissions (aka “plant food”) have beengreatly overstated.3 For example:
•  Corporate climate policy is often guided by the Paris Agreement, which is heavily informed by the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.4 These targets are neither legally binding nor legitimized byscientific evidence.
•  The IPCC’s most extreme scenario unrealistically assumes a return to a previous era of unrestricted fossil fuelusage and heavy reliance on coal power.5 This extreme scenario is unlikely now that most nations have climatepolicies in place.6
•  Regarding catastrophic scenarios that are highly unlikely but are treated as the expectation, “the media then
often amplifies this message, sometimes without communicating the nuances. This results in further confusionregarding probable emissions outcomes, because many climate researchers are not familiar with the details ofthese scenarios in the energy-modeling literature.”7
•  These apocalyptic predictions have been repeatedly proven false.8 Climate models used to predict futureevents “may be overly sensitive to carbon dioxide increases and therefore project future warming that isunrealistically high.”9
•  When given historical data, climate models project impossibly high temperatures that are inconsistent with fossil
evidence—yet they’re still used by the IPCC.
•  Hydrocarbons are reliable and cost-efficient. Renewable energy will not replace hydrocarbons in the near future,if ever.10 ConocoPhillips Company’s (“ConocoPhillips” or the “Company”) competitors are betting big on continueddemand for oil and gas.11

"[Page 128]
Item 5: Stockholder Proposal — Revisit Pay Incentives for GHG Emission Reductions
Supporting Statement: Despite the evidence that climate alarmism is overstated, ConocoPhillips’s executive payprogram incorporates unnecessary incentives to assumed combat climate change.
•  According to the Company’s 2023 Proxy Statement, the Human Resources and Compensation Committee set a
Variable Cash Incentive Program target of 14 percent of total compensation for the CEO and 16 percent for otherNamed Executive Officers.12
•  “Strategic and ESG Milestones” are one of the five metrics used to determine VCIP for NEOs. These
milestones include:
 - “Demonstrated meaningful progress toward our Paris-aligned climate risk framework.”
 - “Progressed our long-term strategy by establishing new methane and flaring targets, executing emission
reduction projects, and progressing CCS business development opportunities.”
These VCIP metrics are unscientific and create a breach of fiduciary duty. ConocoPhillips is an oil and gas companyand should focus on what it does best. The company cannot afford to be left behind because of misguided executivepay incentives.
Resolved: Shareholders of ConocoPhillips request the Board of Directors’ Human Resources and CompensationCommittee to revisit its incentive guidelines for executive pay, to emphasize legitimate fiduciary goals and considereliminating greenhouse gas reduction targets and other scientifically dubious goals from compensation inducements.
What vote is required to approve this proposal?
Approval of this proposal requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or represented byproxy at the Annual Meeting and entitled to vote on the proposal.
WHAT DOES THE BOARD RECOMMEND?
The Board recommends you vote AGAINST this proposal for the following reasons:
The Board has carefully considered the recommendations set forth in the proposal and we believe the changessuggested are not in the best interest of ConocoPhillips or our stockholders for the following reasons:
Our executive compensation is aligned with our company strategy and with the long-term interests ofour stockholders.
ConocoPhillips continues to be guided by our value proposition of superior returns to stockholders through price cycleswhile executing against our Triple Mandate, which sets out three objectives to align our actions with the underlyingrealities of our business and demonstrates our commitment to create long-term value for our stockholders. Our TripleMandate includes reliably and responsibly delivering oil and gas production to meet energy transition pathway demand,delivering returns on and of capital for our stockholders, and remaining focused on achieving our net-zero operationalemissions ambition. Consistent with our philosophy of aligning our executive compensation programs with companystrategy and with the long-term interests of our stockholders, our executive compensation programs and metrics remainaligned with our value proposition and Triple Mandate (see page 72).
An overwhelming majority of our stockholders have expressed a desire for us to link compensation with ourclimate commitments.
We regularly meet with stockholders on a variety of topics, including our executive compensation programs. In recentyears, during these engagements, an overwhelming majority of stockholders have sought to confirm how we linkprogress on our climate commitments to our executive compensation programs. Recently, ConocoPhillips created aseparately weighted measure (10 percent) for “Energy Transition Milestones,” for our short-term incentive program (seepage 82), and almost all of our stockholders supported our modified compensation program. For more information onour stockholder engagement, see “Stockholder Engagement and Board Responsiveness” beginning on page 45 and “2023Say on Pay Vote Result, Stockholder Engagement, and Board Responsiveness” beginning on page 69.
AGAINST For the foregoing reasons, the Board recommends you vote AGAINST this stockholder proposal.

If your shares are held in a brokerageaccount or bank, you are considered the “beneficial owner” or “street name” holder of those shares.
What is a broker non-vote?
Brokers may use their discretion to vote shares held in street name on matters considered “routine” under NYSE rules.Brokers may not vote shares held in street name on non-routine matters unless they have received voting instructionsfrom the beneficial owners. Shares that are not voted on non-routine matters are called broker non-votes.

Resources
Based on the Petroleum Resources Management System, a system developed by industry that classifies recoverablehydrocarbons into commercial and sub-commercial to reflect their status at the time of reporting. Proved, probable,and possible reserves are classified as commercial, while remaining resources are categorized as sub-commercialor contingent. The company’s resource estimate includes volumes associated with both commercial and contingentcategories. The SEC permits oil and gas companies, in their filings with the SEC, to disclose only proved, probable, andpossible reserves. U.S. investors are urged to consider closely the oil and gas disclosures in our Form 10-K and otherreports and filings with the SEC.
Cost of Supply
Cost of supply is the WTI equivalent price that generates a 10 percent after-tax return on a point-forward and fullyburdened basis. Fully burdened includes capital infrastructure, foreign exchange, price-related inflation, G&A, andcarbon tax (if currently assessed). If no carbon tax exists for the asset, carbon pricing aligned with internal energyscenarios is applied. All barrels of resource in the cost of supply calculation are discounted at 10 percent.

### Item 5: Stockholder Proposal – Revisit Pay Incentives for GHG Emission Reductions
**Summary of Extracted Information**
